[DhtmlXQ_comment0]The BGN challenge was one of the biggest events in its time.||In the first ever tournament, Grandmaster Xu Yinchuan and Grandmaster Tao Hanming were the finalists. ||This was the first game in their six game match.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Black showed that he was prepared when he played P7+1 at this point. Red would not be able to play the P3+1 variation and also the 57 Cannons with Double Filed Chariots variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]P7+1 would also be viable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]The opening system was decided.||Red would have chosen the Central Cannon with Filed and Ranked Chariots. Black chose the Screen Horse Defense with Double Headed Snake Pawns.||　[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Steadfast approach. ||A4+5 is also viable. [/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]P3+1 is another way to play the position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]P3+1 would be another way to play this position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]In the old days, R6+5 was played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Black would lose tempo if R1=4 were played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red would try to pry open the Black defense with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Steadfast approach to the game. ||If Red wanted a complicated position, R7-1 could have been played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Black could consider H7+8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]What would happen if Black chose to attack with R8+8?[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]R4+7 would have been a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Black could consider C2-3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment80]Black could have played more aggressively with H6+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment86]Black could consider R4-4 to simplify the situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment88]The last Black blunder.||R4=1 would not have lost material. It would be a pseudosacrifice.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment88]
[DhtmlXQ_comment100]Black cannot afford to lose his elephant on the bottom rank. It would be very hard for Black to draw the game now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment109]Red cannot play R2+2. ||As long as Red had the option of a discovered attack, it would be very hard for Black to draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment109]
[DhtmlXQ_comment119]Red saw the opportunity and chose to move his Elephant to the riverbank, dislodging the Black horse and forcing the Black horse to adjust its position. ||It would be the mark of an experienced player.[/DhtmlXQ_comment119]
[DhtmlXQ_comment125]The Red Chariot would limit the movement ofthe Black Horse and allow the Red King to adjust his position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment125]
[DhtmlXQ_comment141]R2+2 would also be viable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment142]If Black played K4=5, Red woudl advance his chariot R8+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment142]
[DhtmlXQ_comment158]The only way that Black could force a draw would be maneuver the Horse and Elephants into the Horse Three Elephants Formation, which would now be impossible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment158]
[DhtmlXQ_comment193]In 1r vs. 1h2e endgame situations, (of course when the weaker side had not been able to achieve the Horse Three Elephants Formation), the key to winning would be to dislodge and chase away horse such that the central file cannot be protected. The chariot would then try to find ways to capture one of the elephants. Such endgame situations would greatly favor the chariot side.||In this situation, Black would be forced to play E7+9, where Red would pin the edeg elephant and horse with R6=1. Black would be sure to lose material and that was why Black resigned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment193]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_153]Red would also have a winning situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_153]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_114]Black would capture the Red pawn by force and it would be a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_114]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_86]If Red accepted the trade, the situation on the board would become 1h1c1p2a2e vs. 2h2a2e. It would be a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_92]Black would still be able to hold on![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_46]The Red cannon on the 8th file would be immobilized.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_46]Black would now offer to trade his right horse which was under pressure for the Red riverbank horse which was a major threat. Black would ease some pressure.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_44]Black would be prepared to play R4+7 to gain initiative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_45]Although Black would have gained an elephant, his Cannon was without backup. Black would have to worry about the Black cannon and also Red" width="500" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
