[DhtmlXQ_comment0]1985 Five Rams Cup Liu Dahua Lost Li Laiqun||The following was a commentary by Wu Qisheng that was from 《五羊杯冠军赛名局赏析》.||The event was the 1985 Five Rams Cup. It was the fifth event ever and fighting for 3rd place was Grandmaster Liu Dahua who took Red and Grandmaster Li Laiqun who took Black. ||The match was hotly contested and lasted well over nine hours, starting from 7+pm and ending at 4.40am. ||In this match, Red started with the Pawn Opening with Central Cannon Variation. Black counterd with the Thundering Defense and Opposite Direction Elephant. ||In the opening phase, Liu chose a variation whereby a pwan was sacrificed. Because the Black right Chariot was developed relatively late in the game, Liu chose to trade away Lis left chariot. By the 36th ply, Red had control over the entire situation. ||However, Black defended proactively and slowed the attack by Red. The situation on the board became tense as both grandmasters went at it. ||For this 59th ply, Grandmaster Li chose to sacrifice his horse which led to one of the climax of the game. The entire game was very tense. These are the following moves.||[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]？[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]As Red had captured the Black central Pawn with no backup, this cannon would have trouble developing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Proactive approach to the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Black chose to sacrifice his Elephant to allow his Chariot to join in the attack. ||黑方弃象，迅速开出右车，投入战斗。以下红方如走马四进五，则车4进7，以下红如走：甲、马五退六；乙、马五进三，均为黑胜。[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]Good move for Red to control the situation. ||H4+5 would not have been idea.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]

[DhtmlXQ_comment119]Red would lose if C3=5 were played to capture the Horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment119]
[DhtmlXQ_comment145]H4+6 would have been a better option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment145]
[DhtmlXQ_comment149]?||Perhaps the aggressive play by Li Laiqun was too much for Liu, or perhaps the match had already lasted for too long. Red blundered seriously with this move. ||R3=4 would have won the game for Red![/DhtmlXQ_comment149]
[DhtmlXQ_comment156]Black could not let down his guard and play R7+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment156]
[DhtmlXQ_comment158]C9=7 should have been played. Black could have offered to sacrifice his Chariot to win with a smothered cannon checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment158]
[DhtmlXQ_comment162]Red was forced to trade his Horse and Cannon for the Black Pawn. Black would now have the material advantage and a winning position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment162]
[DhtmlXQ_comment163]As the Black Pawn occupied the Centroid, Red tried to sacrifice his Cannon to defuse the situation. ||R5=6 would not be an option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment163]
[DhtmlXQ_comment314]Black won.[/DhtmlXQ_comment314]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_164]Black would be prepared to play C5=4 for the win (followed by R7=4).[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_164]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_160]Black would raise his advisor as a prophylactic move and prepare to play R7+1 for the win![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_160]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_162]!||Black would threaten to checkmate with C7+7. Advantage to Black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_162]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_162]! ||Black could offer his Chariot again so that a checkmate with C7+7 would be possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_162]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_159]Red would force a trade of chariots and it would be a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_159]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_151]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_151]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_124]Red would be forced to sacrifice his Chariot to capture the Black Pawn. Either way, Black would win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_124]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_55]H5+3 would not be viable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_55]
