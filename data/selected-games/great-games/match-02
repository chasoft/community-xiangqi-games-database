[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg20200804 2004 jiazhou04 B42 WGM 張國鳳 Zhang Guofeng Lost to WGM 王琳娜 Wang Linna ||||賽事/Contest Name: ||第4屆“嘉周杯”全國象棋特級大師冠軍賽 Jiazhou04 ||4th Jiazhou Cup Chinese National Xiangqi Grandmasters Invitation||日期/Date: 2005年3月4日||地點/Venue: 淄博 Zībó||||張國鳳 Zhang Guofeng from 江蘇 Jiangsu vs. 王琳娜 Wang Linna from 黑龍江 Heilongjiang||Result: 黑勝 Black won||ECCO:B42 五六炮左正馬對反宮馬 56 Cannons with Left Proper Horse vs. Sandwiched Horse Defense||||Jim: This match was played in 2004 in an invitational tournament for grandmasters. ||The game played here was between two Womens Individual Champions, Zhang Guofeng and Wang Linna. ||Commentary was by the winner of the match, WGM Wang Linna herself. ||The file was found over the internet.||||[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]||Choosing to attack with the 56 Cannons is one of WGM Zhang Guofeng preferred way of playing this position. We had met and played this variation quite a few times in the past.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]||As can be seen from the figure, charging the central pawn forward would not be commonly seen in actual play. Usually, R8+6 is played.||In the match between Zhang Guofeng and Chen Lichun the following day, the same position was reached and R8+6 was played instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]After some analysis, I felt that if I had wanted to be able to fend off the Red attack, advancing my chariot to the enemy pawn rank would be a necessary move to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red would continue to attack and carry out her strategy of choosing to attack rapidly. ||If R8+6 were played, Red could have played C6=7 and Black would stil have a playable position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Defending with the elephant was a cool headed move. Black cannot be hasty to play P5+1 to capture the pawn. The prsence of the Red chariot on the enemy pawn rank was a huge threat and Red Black would not have gained much after capturing the pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]||As can be seen in the position, I took a long time to make this move. After much deliberation, I chose a more defensive prone move. ||Black could also choose to play R2+1 or R4=3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]From the way the match went, Red tried to hard to force her moves and the result was not ideal. She should have chosen to draw the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Traversing the cannon to pin the Red chariot and horse would be a good move to increase initiative.||P5+1 would give Red a chance to counter-attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Choosing to attack the chariots was not efficient. A better move would be H7+5[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52] ||H7+5 would have been better. ||Black would have the material superiority and be sure to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]If Red played P6+1, I could have answered with R1=4. Red would not have a line of attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]Black won.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]||Red would have trouble continuing attacking this file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_58]Black would have the material superiority and be sure to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]Black would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_51]Red would be given a chance to fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]Variation 1[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_35]The positioning of the Red pieces would be much better than Black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_30]Variation 2[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]A possible line[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_39]||Red would command a huge advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]||Weak move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]||If R8=7 were played, Black would defend with R2+2 and be prepared to retreat his cannon C1-1 to start retaliating. Red would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_26]Black would have a playable position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]Commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]||The following were the moves that were played between Zhang Guofeng and Chen Lichun.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]Red had the advantage and would go on to win the match.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]
