[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120607 2006 ygl Liu Zongze L Chen Lichun E17||ECCO E17 Angel's pawn vs Thundering defence with same direction cannons variation||ECCO:E17 ???????????????||||This game was played in 2006 in the 2nd ever Yang Guanlin cup. Although red played the angel's opening as the first move, the game quickly progressed to the same direction cannons variation.||||It was also a battle of the sexes. ||Comments were provided by Master Yang Deqi[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]"This was the second ever Yang Guanlin cup. And this game in particular was an intergender competition. After 2 moves each, both players opted for the same direction cannons variation. This is a favourite opening for aggressive players."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]"Red shows that he wants to speed the development of his chess pieces with this move. If H2+3 ..."||Please click on the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]"Black plays the side horse to increase the development of her chess pieces also. This is considered to be a more proactive approach. P7+1 is not advisable now as it actually allows red to have an easy game!" ||Please click on the variations below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]"Red chooses a balanced and firm variation with the palcornder cannons. Other commonly variations include R9=8...which could lead to  very aggressive variations for both sides. "||Please click on the variations to understand what would happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]"P1+1 is another possible option for red, allowing for an exchange of chariots with R1+3 as a continuation."[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]"R1=2 is another possible option. ||Black could answer with R1+1 or P3+1" ||Please click on the variations to see Master Yang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"R1=2 is another feasible option. That way, red can develop his right chariot first before choosing his target of attack. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]"As seen at this stage in the game, Black chooses a correct counter to start his oiffensive. This move would prove very beneficial to the further development of black's chess pieces. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]"Red could also choose to play R1=3. That way, red would have more choices to choose from as the game progresses. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]"At this stage in the game, red's chess pieces are dispersed all over the place. Red should adjust his formation for better defense and offense. It woud be better that red played H7+6 now..."||Please click on the variation below to understand Master Yang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]"A bad move. Red should have played R2+2, as even though he would be on the receiving end, red could still hold on. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]"Looking at the board, we see that black has made a brilliant move to gain material!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]"After gaining material, black simplifies things with this simple exchange."?[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]"And red resigned. Red's defensive formation is weak and scattered, the position of his only major chess piece, the cannon is very poor. There was no way that he could handle black's aggressions so he resigned. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_47]"And red would be able to hold off black's aggressions. Even though red has yet to move his right chariot, aiming for a draw with the current material and defensive formation is not impossible!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]"And red would hold on to his lead in the game..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]"And red would be the aggressor."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_10]"And red could choose to continue with R8+5 or R8+4, both of which would lead to very very aggressive variations."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_6]"Charging the pawn forward is too rash now!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_12]"And red could choose from R8=2 or R8=3 for a double attack on red's chess pieces. Red would have an easy time now!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_10]"And red would have a hard time controlling or increasing the lead in his game. "||Jim: for beginners, red had made 3 moves with the horse, and has allowed black's pawn to crosss the river. Whether red decides to exchange the horse or play H8+7, he would be in a dilemma either way.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_10]
