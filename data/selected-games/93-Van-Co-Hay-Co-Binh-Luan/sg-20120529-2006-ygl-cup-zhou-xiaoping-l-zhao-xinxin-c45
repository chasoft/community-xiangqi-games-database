[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120529 2006 YGL Cup Zhou Xiaoping L Zhao Xinxin C45||ECCO C45 Central cannon with pawn ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen horse defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge cannon for chariot exchange variation. ||ECCO:C45 ?????????????????||Another nice file from the internet.||Commentary was provided by Master Dang Pei. His remarks are given in quotation marks.||Zhou Xiaoping is an amateur player, who has made a big name for himself over the past 2 decades. Although not professional, his level is has been described as Master or nearly GM. GM Zhao Xinxin was not GM yet when this game was played. He needs no introduction.||||"This game was played in 2006 in the coveted Yang Guanlin cup. ||After 10 rounds of competition, Zhao Xinxin, Wang Yanh and Zhou Xiaoping were in the leading pack and the champion would be decided amongst them. ||This was the last round of the game. ||In the first game,  Zhou Xiaoping (8 points) vs Zhao Xinxin (8.5 points). In the second game, Wang Yang (8 points) vs Zheng Yihong (7.5 points). As can be seen , if Zhou were able to win Zhao, Zhou would be either the champion or runner up. If Zhao wanted to become champion, he would have to beat Zhou. It was under such circumstances that this game began!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]"Shanxi's Xiangqi king Zhou Xiaoping did very well in this tournament, After 10 rounds of competition, he emerged undefeated with a record of 6W4D and was placed 3rd overall. In the last round of the competition, he played red against Master Zhao (who had yet to become national chamopion and gm ). Zhou was in a position to win the tournament and he showed his intentions by playing this very complex variation of C9+4. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]"Black tries to move into uncharted waters with this move! Black does so to try to search for chances to win! The common move to play for black would be C2+4 ..."||Pls click on the variation to see the commonly played moves...[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]"If H7+6 was played instead..."||Pls click on the variation below...[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]"Red played this move to prevent black from moving C6-2 to attack his cross river chariot. Another alternative would be to play R9=5..."||Please click on the variation to see the moves suggested![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]"Perhaps C6-1 would be an alternative ... "||Pls click on the variation to see Master Dang's recommendations![/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"As seen in fig 1, Red's cannon taking the side pawn is a bad move. Red has not anticipated the grave effects of black's palcorner horse, and it would give black full control of the game thereon. "||Pls click on the variation below to understand Master Dang's comments.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]"R7=2 for the direct kill would be even more aggressive!!!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]"This year's Yang Guanlin Cup was 'televised' live on the web, using the Guangdong Xiangqi Net as a platform. Taking the last round for example, all you had to do was to click on the board you wished to see, and you would be able to leave comments too! And because this game was a major deciding factor in who would become champion, it was viewed by many, and there was a heated discussion as the game went on. Somebody on the net mentioned that black would have won if he played C8+7! and this comment drew much response!||Is it so? If you analysed the game more closely, red would be able to save himself with R4=2."||Pls click on the variation to understand Master Dang's analysis.[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]"And black did not see a chance for a quick win! H3+1 would be better!!! "||Pls click on the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]"Red is forced to sacrifice the pawn. If C7+3 ..."||Pls click on the variation to understand what would happen![/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]"C7+3 to attack the horse might have been a feasible alternative as it would turn the game into one of speed. Both sides would have their chances. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment96]"During the past few rounds, Zhao threatens to kill with each move! A further horse sacrifice shows the courage and will to kill! "[/DhtmlXQ_comment96]
[DhtmlXQ_comment100]"As seen in the board, black should have played H6+7 .."||Pls click on the variation ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment117]"Both parties were in time trouble in the latter stages of the game,which explains why the move in the latter stages were not as 'tight'as they should have been. The game had become more drawish and although black had the clear advantage, it would still take some time before he would be able to convert it into a win. And chances for a draw were distinctively highter. Unfortunately, Red's time red out and was awarded a loss. With this win, GM Zhao Xinxin became the champion amidst much excitement!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment117]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_104]"and black would have won with the material advantage!" ||For beginners, red cannot take the black cannon with H8-7 as black has a checkemate with R7=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_104]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_76]"And red would be not far from defeat!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_72]"And red would be sure to lose the chariot. Black would win in a jiffy!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_66]"Internet suggestion..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_69]"And black would be the loser after these few exchanges!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_57]"And red would still have control of the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_39]"Red would have R9=4 to capture the black cannon as a follow up threat!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]"If black decided to continue with this move..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_45]"Red would still have a small lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]"Another possible alternative!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]"And red would still be better!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_32]"And black would still be able to attack red chariot with C7=6 on the next move ...Black can be pleased with this exchange!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]"Commonly played move.."[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]"And it would be an all out war with both sides having their areas of concern..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]
