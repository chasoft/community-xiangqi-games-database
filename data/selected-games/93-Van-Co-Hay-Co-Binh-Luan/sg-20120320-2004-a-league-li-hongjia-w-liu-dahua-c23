[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120320 2004 A League Li Hongjia W Liu Dahua ||ECCO: C23 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th Filed horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double Headed Snake Pawn Formation ||ECCO:C23 ???????????????||Another game from the team championships in 2004 whereby Master Li Hongjia goes up against GM Liu Dahua.||Master Li Hongjia was once invited to play in the 5 Rams Cup and had good results then.||This is one of the most exciting games in round 8 of the General's tournament!||Commentary was given by Master Yang Deqi.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]If Red were to play P7+1 , black could answer with C8=9 or H7+6 for very complex variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]One of the better choices for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And the opening becomes the Central Cannon with Filed and Ranked chariots vs Screen Horse Defense with double headed snake pawn formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]One of the common ways where black can counter red's offending pawn ranked chariot.||If black plays A4+5 now, red would play R9=6 and under most circumstances, red would still firmly hold on to his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]P7+1 is also commonly played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black accepts the sacrifice!||C2+1 is another alternative. ||With this move, black opts for more control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]R9=4 is also played often instead of this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Correct move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]An aggressive move from red!||Red does not care about the elephant on the bottom rank and decides to go for it! He tempts black to take that elephant instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]C5=3 is also feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]The elephant is poisoned![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]This move was of the more fashionable plays from red back in 2004. ||In the past, C8+1 was played...||Please click on the variation to see it![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]One of the better moves from red. ||C2+3 is another complex variation from black!||Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]H6-7 is another possibility for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And it becomes a chariotless game!||Xiangqi skills are put to an extreme![/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Good move from red!||Red chooses to protect his side pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]A better move from black![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]H2+3 would be too rash now![/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment64]And the game enters the endgame stage. ||2c2p2a2e vs 2c1p2a2e.||If red plays correctly, his chances of a win are huge.[/DhtmlXQ_comment64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]Post game analysis suggests that not much is done with this move. P5+1 would be more proactive.[/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment87]And red prepares to readjust his formation for attack with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment102]For the past few moves, red does not hurry his pace of attack. ||By forcing the black pawn from being a high pawn to a low pawn now, red has effectively decreased the threat that his pawn might pose in the future, thereby increasing his chances of a win![/DhtmlXQ_comment102]
[DhtmlXQ_comment110]Post-game analysis suggests C5=1 as better defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment110]
[DhtmlXQ_comment113]Good move! ||And red is in control![/DhtmlXQ_comment113]
[DhtmlXQ_comment117]It is time to charge the pawn now![/DhtmlXQ_comment117]
[DhtmlXQ_comment121]Nice move!||Black is hit hard with this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment121]
[DhtmlXQ_comment122]As black is unable to defend against red P6+1, all he can do is to sacrifice his cannon for the pawn and try to hang in there![/DhtmlXQ_comment122]
[DhtmlXQ_comment128]Black tries to provide some defense with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment128]
[DhtmlXQ_comment131]![/DhtmlXQ_comment131]
[DhtmlXQ_comment133]!!! Great move!||An advisor sacrifice!||With this sacrifice, the black pawn is rendered functionless.[/DhtmlXQ_comment133]
[DhtmlXQ_comment141]Red plays brilliantly in the past few moves with the advisor sacrifice.||GM Liu resigns! ||I have added the following moves to show the beginner why![/DhtmlXQ_comment141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment142]Say black moves the cannon, the ending would still be the same.[/DhtmlXQ_comment142]
[DhtmlXQ_comment149]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment149]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_143]and red wins with the double cannons checkmate on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_143]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_128]Bad move![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_128]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_139]And red would win with C8-1 on the next move![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_139]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_57]and red would still retain the upperhand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_49]And red would gain back the lost material.||Red's lead in the game would be larger than in the  actual game played. Black would have a harder time trying for a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_41]This is also feasible...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]And red would still have the lead but one less side pawn as compared to the move actually played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]Might be slightly better![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_45]Although black is on the receiving end, red would still have to put in much effort for a win![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]Not advisable![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_45]And red would have the upper hand in the cross fire![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]And red would be better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_31]Nope, bad counter from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_38]And black would have seized the lead from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_29]Another commonly played move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_36]At this stage, red has the material upperhand but black has the control.||Both sides have their areas of conceern.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_28]Not good![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_37]And red has a good chance of a win![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_27]A possible alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_42]And it would still be a relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_25]And black is bound to lose either horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_25]And red would be firmly in control of this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_19]This is another alternative commonly played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]And it would be a knotty game. The tempo of the game has slowed down much![/DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_10]Nope![/DhtmlXQ_comment16_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_13]And red would start attacking from the center![/DhtmlXQ_comment16_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_15]Red would be in control![/DhtmlXQ_comment16_15]
