[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120510 1999wc Xu Yinchuan w Yan Wenqing C24||ECCO C24 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th filed horse vs Screen horse defence with Double headed snake pawn formation||ECCO:C24 ???????????????||||This was another file I found on the internet recently. It was a game played by GM Xu and commented by himself. His opponent was Master Yan Wenqing, an openings specialist. Master Yan is a much feared competitor who nearly won the national championships. He is also the husband of Hu Ming, perhaps the greatest female xq player of all time. ||GM Xu's comments are given in quotation marks.||||"Hebei's Master Yan Wenqing is a great player. Indeed, amongst Xiangqi masters, he can be considered one of the leaders of the pack. His xiangqi is full of creativity and very deep and precise in the moves. Seeing his games is like breathing in a breath of fresh air. In terms of personal achievements, Master Yan came in 4th and 5th place in 1990 and 1991. In the following years, however, Master Yan suffered some setbacks but roared back again in 1998, when he nearly won the national championships. Perhaps his psyche was not strong enough, he came in runner up after leading in points most of the way. But in retrospect, which great Xiangqi player never suffered any setbacks? A loss actually tells the player where his weaknesses. If we could learn from our weaknesses, it might not be such a bad thing after all. ||Ok, enough of the small talk. The World Championships in 1999 provided another stage for Master Yan to shine again. After just 5 rounds, he was leading in the points earned, showing his Xiangqi prowess and capabilities. In the sixth round, we met, and to a certain degree, this match was more of a match for first and second place for the both of us. " ||Whew...what an introduction ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Just in case you did not know, Master Yan is an openings specialist. Together with Master Zhang Qiang from Beijing, their 3 books series on openings is one of the best books on openings over the past 2 decades. ||GM Xu mentioned that in 1998, Master Yan had a chance of a lifetime to win that tournament. But if you have read GM Bu Fengbo's biography, you would know that Master Yan actually lost the championship to none other than GM Xu.||So, Master Yan was thirsty for revenge when this game was played. --Jim[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]"When faced against an openings specialist of Master Yan's caliber, choosing a suitable opening was a huge task. It was also to Master Yan's favor as all he needed was a draw and would continue to lead all competitors in the number of points earned. This made my situation worse. But isn't life like that? We had to face our challenges and obstacles head on.||Common sense tells us to use our strenghts to attack our opponent's weaknesses.But where did my strenths lie and what were Master Yan's weaknesses? I did not know. After much consideration, not that I had not prepared for the match, I chose this opening more out of necessity than strategy. It was like making a choice out of nothing. "||Jim: Ok, I tried my best to describe and translate what GM Xu wrote. Picking the mind of a GM is not a simple task, much worse than choosing an opening against Master Yan. But we face life's obstacles head-on... LOL||GM Xu continues :||" At this stage, Master Yan did not play H2+3 and played P7+1 instead. This was because he would thus be able to avoid the following variations..."||Please click on the variations below to understand what did Master Yan refused to play...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]"At this stage, I chose to play the pawn ranked chariot. This was to prevent Master Yan from playing C8+4, forming a blockade of my right flank, thereby stifling the development of my chess pieces. At this stage, the pawn ranked chariot or the riverbank chariot are possible options ..."||Jim: ok, the pawn ranked chariot is an orthodox move. but the riverbank chariot would be more controversial, as it lacks a specific target to attack. Please view some of the opening boards in the beginner's section under the openings board. But if a GM says that is is ok, it would be ok. I can live with that. ||Chris Hankinson: "in the analysis of the xu yinchuan vs. yan wenqing game.........when mr, xu says the pawn ranked chariot it possible, it is because black's 7-pawn is advanced.   this provides a "target"  or at least a purpose for the red chariot to support P3+1. In the earlier examples you talk about (GM Liu Dianzhong), the pawn is not advanced....this is why he says there is no target." ||Jim: --> ah, words of wisdom from another great player.... Looks like I had better start reading the stuff I upload ;)[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]"By advancing this move, red's chariot is forced to retreat to the riverbank. It was a less volatile choice. It shows that for this game, Master Yan was aiming for a draw first, instead of aggression. "||Jim: for beginners, black's P3+1 and P7+1 finishes the double headed snake pawn formation. Red gives up developing his horses to get his chariots developed, and black chooses development of his horses over his chariots. And when both P3 and P7 are advanced, it leaves red the central file to attack, or to exchange the pawns on the 3rd and 7th files as the game progresses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]"In the past, it was a habit of mine to play P3+1. Indeed, in the first half of 1999, I had played this variation two times. The variations are as follows... "||Jim: Click on the variation below to see what GM Xu liked to play.||"It was impossible that Master Yan did not know about these variations. Therefore, in actual play, I decided to change moves and play P7+1 instead, hoping to thwart Master Yan's plans for an element of surprise..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"If you flip through the books, it was hard to find this move that I made. To my knowledge, I had only played it against Lv Qin in a game of lightning chess in 1998, and it did achieve desirable resutls.||I chose to play this move again because instead of playing R6+5, which seemed old fashioned, this move would seem out of the ordinary and perhaps even unorthodox. The game that I played against Lv Qin was a game of lightning chess, so most people might not have noted it. ||My strategy was to try to deviate the game as far away as possible from the norm. This was because I could thus avoid being hit by any traps or flying daggers that Master Yan might have prepared. By playing this move, I could also add psychological stress to Master Yan, as I had been playing the opening is lightning speed, giving him a false impression that I had been preparing this opponent .... "||Jim: It gets harder by the move trying to pick the brain of the great GM![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]"Master Yan spent quite a bit of time thinking about this move. It shows that he had not been prepared. But he was nevertheless an opening's specialist with his own view of the game. What he played was a very target specific move which did I could not do much. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]" I tried to make the game complex by offering a 4 pawn exchange. I had hoped that by making things complex, I could gain something in the complex variations that followed. But Master Yan was like a mountain, refusing to give in. His two cannons protected the riverbank, and all his advisors and elephants were in the correct positions and defended the black king well.  It was like heavily defended fortress.||If Master Yan had chose to play P3+1 ... "||Please click on the variation to see what might have happened if black choase P3+1 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]"After a series of short exchanges, the game became drawish. But Master Yan had used up much time in this match, which would become a factor as the game progressed. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]"Although black's formation was solid and stable,his chess pieces were nevertheless still on the defensive end. It was a worry that Master Yan had. That was why Master Yan played this move, he addressed this worry, trying to be aggressive by attacking the elephant. R8=4 was also another option..."||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]"And I decided to forsake the elephant. By charging my horse into Yan's territory, I prevented the development of his right black horse and had prepared to let my left cannon join in the attack. This aggression must have forced Master Yan to think that my elephant was poisoned. It made him change his strategy from a more aggressive oriented approach to a more defensive one...."[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]" And this was this move that lost the game for black! Black should have played R7+5..."||Please click on the variations below to see GM Xu's recommendations."[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]" I decided to pounce on red's center. The idea was to try to decrease the effects of black's riverbank cannon as black's entire defense was basically dependent on how well this riverbank cannon fared..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]"The previous two moves of moving the advisor and elephant were not idle moves. The were made to enable the left red cannon to play C8+3! It was a plan that black would had trouble defending against. ||Master Yan was now lagging in the game and was also in time trouble, and he was pressured to moved.||This was not a good move.||Black should have played C3=2 to prevent my C8+3 ..."||Please click on the variation below to understand what GM Xu was saying...[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]This was the plan that GM Xu had hatched!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]"At this stage, I had to escape the black's pin. I had one more pawn to go before winning the game!"||Jim: please look at red's move 23, E7+9. That move had been made to protect this C7-3 move...!||red's 22nd move A6+5 has also prevented the black chariot from moving to the other side of the board, effectively containing the black chariot to this half of the board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]"After exchanging the central pawn, I could take away the side pawn too in the process. It would become a 1r1c1p sw 1r2a2e surewin endgame situation. Black resigns ...||Master Yan lost because his psyche was not in the best of shape, and I hope he would address this problem in the future.||After this win, my hopes of winning the championship were high. I went on to win He Rongyao from West Malaysia and Macau's Xiangqi king Li Jinhuan. Master Yan drew against Wu Guilin from Taiwan in the round 8. This meant that in the final round, when I drew against Hong Kong's Huang Zhiqiang, I would win the tournament. ||Master Yan came in runner up and Wu Guilin was third. ||Becoming World Champion was a big milestone in my career, But the road ahead in the search for the spirit of Xiangqi still beckoned. Although the spirit of Xiangqi may be beyond the grasp of any mortal man in a mere lifetime, the calling is there. ||In the olds of the ancients, ???????,??????? ... (heck, how to you translate this...?!, try google, i think you might get very interesting results...).||I would also like to take this opportunity to thank �????�for giving me the opportunity to  write this column and I thank all my readers for their support. "||||Jim: Whew...The mind of a GM is not one of a mere mortal...I have done my best to translate what GM Xu has written.[/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]"And red would still have a hard time trying to win.."[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_48]"And things would still not be too bad for black!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_40]"And the might of the black's third file chariot would be obvious. "||Jim : for beginners, black's chariot actually has pinned red's chariot and horse in the same file. If red moved the horse away, black could gain a chariot with C3+5 for a discovered attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_43]"And although black was one horse down, black's C8+5 would signal the start of a fierce attack. The cannon and chariot combination could cause all sorts of trouble. Black could also gain back lost material with R7-7."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_48]"And as red has lost both his elephants, it would be hard for red to compete against the might of the black chariots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_40]"And black's defense would still be inpenetratable."[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]"And things would get very complex in a jiffy. This was what Master Yan did not hope to happen." (Master Yan was aiming for a draw.)[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]"At this stage in the game,there would be two major variations from here on. Red could play H3+5 or H7+5, whereby black would answer with C8=6. In both variations, red would still be able to maintain a slight lead in the game. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]"And red would continue to play P5+1 for a very aggressive game by both sides."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_7]"which would turn into the 57 or 58 cannons with 3rd Pawn advancement vs the screen horse defense..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_7]" and red could use either the 56 cannons or 57 cannons..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_7]
