[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120520 Tao Haming L Wan Chunlin||ECCO E17 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon variation vs Thundering Defense with Same Direction Cannons variation.||ECCO:E17 ???????????????||||I found two different files explaining this game, one by GM Liu Dianzhong and the other by female GM Shan Xiali. This was one of the games played in the North Vs  South Xq championships. Unfortunately I have been unable to find the actual date of the competion but it should have taken place in the 90's or early 21st centuries.||GM Tao Hanming takes on GM Wan Chunlin in this interesting game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]"When you study and analyze GM Wan's games against the Angel's Pawn, you would find that he would play the central elephant most of the time. With this same direction counter, you know that he has prepared well for this match."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]"By retreating the cannon to the throat rank, black can prevent red from playing R8+8, and also play H8+7 to protect the pawn that has crossed the river. It is a multi-purposed move. It looks like in this game, GM Wan has prepared much since he deliberately chose to tackle an opening that he was relatively unfamiliar with."[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]"Correct move. It is not advised to play H8+7 now..."||Please click on the variation to see GM Liu's receommendation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]"Red pushes the cannon forward to attack the horse. This is a very cunning tempt from red. If black answers wrongly, black would be in deep trouble immediately!!! ..."||Please click on the variations below to understand why! ||"In the actual game, GM Wan sacrifices his horse early for an aggressive counter. People who know him know that he is more of the cautious type, seldom taking chances in his games. Yet, by playing so aggressively so early, it shows that he had already done his homework well, preparing for this variation!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]"Red must capture this horse now. If red chose to play P7+1 ..." ||Please click on the variations below to see GM Liu's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"Red deliberately chooses to play this move to tempt black to play A6+5... " GM Liu||Please click on the variation on the next move to understand what GM Liu suggested...[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]"Black cannot play R1+2 now..." -- GM Liu||"Black would threaten to capture the red chariot with C7+8... " --- GM Shan||Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]"If black played H4+3 now... " -GM Liu||Please click on GM Liu's suggestions . Very nice lesson to be learnt![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]"Retreating the chariot to black's pawn rank is a proactive move for red! If red played R8-4 instead.. a draw would be highly possible!"||"But Red's proactive behavior would also incense black's ambitions, which is why, when trying to analyse the situation, it is important to consider this aspect of the game also..."||Jim: Tried my best to translate this segment...unfortunately, there seems to be no direct English translation. I welcome anyone who has a better intepretation. GM's Liu's words are as follows "????,???????????????,?4?3,????,??????????????????????????????,??????????�?�,????????????"[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]"In the process of trying to capture the red cannon, black has maneuvered his chariots well, allowing them to join in the attack. That is why black dares to give red an empty headed cannon (that is a central cannon). Red cannot play E3+5 now or black would have a quick win with R1=4! This makes red's predicament go from bad to worse!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]"Black shows his cool when faced with red's threat of capturing the cannon. He fully utilizes the potential of the black horse. If Red played R5+1 now...: -- GM Liu   ||Please click on the variation on the red move to see what GM Liu has to offer![/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]"And after losing the two elephants, red resigns!"|| -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]nope, red cannot play this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]" And black would most probably end up with a surewin endgame of 1h3p sw 1h2a2e. " -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]"No can do..." GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]Jim: And red would win with R2=5. Black would be unable to resolve the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_36]"And black wins!" -- GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]GM Shan's suggestion[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]Suggested move by GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_25]"It would not be long before a draw materializes!" -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]GM Shan's suggested moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]"Red would be in control!" GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_27]"Red would be in control" --GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]"And red would be prepared to gain material with C7+1 on the next move. Thus far, it can be seen that both players do not care much about material gains, but focus more on holding on to the lead and placing more emphasis on control of the game. When to capture material, and how do it comfortably is an art in Xiangqi!" --GM Liu||"Red's game..." --GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]"GM Tao tempting black to make this move ..." --GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]"And red would still have an ideal attack after sacrificing one horse back." -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_21]"And red would be doing ok! " -- GM Liu||Jim:Black would definitely lose an elephant now. Black cannot move H4+3 to regain the horse or Red would simply play C5+4 for a quick win![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_23]"Red would be better! " -- GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]"Not considered..." GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_24]"And in the process of trying to catch the red cannon, black would increase his attacking momentum. That is why GM Tao would not consider playing H7-9 for move 10." GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_19]"Better play..." as suggested by GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_20]"And red's move of C4+5 would be wasted..."-- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]"And after the exchange, black loses the elephant and his troops would be in a mess. " -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_16]Not advisable -- GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_17]" And black would be poised to lose material!"||Jim: For beginners, red can play C3+5 to capture the horse without fear, as black cannot play C5=7 to take back the horse or he would lose his side chariot with C4=9!" -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_18]"Black could be sastififed!"-- GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_16]"Black would still have a game going on." -- GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_12]"Nope" --GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_15]"And red would be better!" -- GM Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_21]"Red is better! " -- GM Shan[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_21]
