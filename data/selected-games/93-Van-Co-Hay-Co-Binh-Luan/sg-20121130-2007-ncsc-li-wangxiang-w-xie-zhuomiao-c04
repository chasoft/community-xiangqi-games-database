[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121130 2007 ncsc Li WangXiang W Xie ZhuoMiao C04 ||ECCO:C04 ?????????||ECCO C04 Central Cannon with 7th Filed Horse vs Screen Horse Defense.||||Jim:I found this file on the internet. Unfortunately, the commentator of this game was not known.||||Master Li WangXiang has rendered his services to the HuBei team for many years and is an expert on the Palcorner Cannon opening.||Black's Master Xie ZhuoMiao is one of the younger players on the SiChuan team and did very well in last year's (2006) National Singles Championships, whereby he managed to obtain the title of Xiangqi Master, and in the process of doing so, becoming the first player from SiChuan Province to be awared the title in over 20 years, thereby breaking the spate of bad luck for the XiangQi powerhouse province.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red's Master Li did not use his Palcorner Cannon opening and instead chose this variation of the central cannon. It looks like he had prepared well coming into this game. ||It must have taken his opponent by surprise.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]And the basic opening is now decided.||Red has chosen the central cannon while black has answered with the screen horse defense with the double cross river cannons variation.||Black's counter has been popular in this year's competition whereby there have been many breakthroughs and new flying daggers. (Jim: For those new to XiangQi, a flying dagger is a move in the opening that would achieve great gains, sort of like a secret weapon.) ||Red's ranked chariot is one of the common counters.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This is one of the more commonly played moves for black as black prepares to play C6+1 on the next move for the skewer.||Another possible move for black would be to play R2+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And this is one of red's commonly made moves, whereby red returns a sacrifice.||Another commonly played move would be C5+1. R6=8 would not be wise as black could sacrifice his horse now, and gain material back later with additional benefits.||Please click on the board to see the variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And this move was one of the biggest flying daggers in this years's competition.||In the past, red would play R6=7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black chooses to return a sacrifice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Correct move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]In retrospect, this move was not straight to the point. ||Black's strategy up till this move was to sacrifice material in exchange for better positioning.||He should have followed his strategy and played C2=5 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]A must make move.||Red cannot be greedy and play R6=7 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]At this stage in the game, black is in an embarassing situation.||There are no obvious areas/files/ranks to attack and worse, black has no decent defense available.||In retrospect, black's R2+4 on move 16 was not wise and denied black the best chance to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]GOOD MOVE!!!||The positioning of black's pieces just became worse. Red has increased his lead in the game greatly.||Jim: Red not only has denied black's C8=5 threat with this move, it also creates space for himself while at the same time limiting black's. The main strategy of black's double cross river cannons is to use material in exchange for limitation of red's pieces thereby slowing the development of red. After this move was played, black's strategy was not fulfilled.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Good move! Red chooses to defend first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]And black's elephant is in trouble.||The king cannot move K5-1 too.||Black is not far from defeat![/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]And black resigned.||Red wins with the double chariots.||Red's H3+5 was one of the hottest variations to become fashionable in this year's compeition.||However, as seen from this game, black did not counter properly and in today's world where information is circulated so quickly, this variation would not last long. ||Jim: Damn, and I just learned this 'new' variation....LOL.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]And black's king would not be able to play K5-1 now! ||Red would be in a winning situation![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_45]And black would suddenly have an attack of his own!||Jim: That is why H7-6 was played to deny black from playing C2=5 in this scenario.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_43]And black would also have a hard time defending![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]And it would be obvious that red is better!||The central horse threatens with the palcorner checkmate any time now.||Jim: Red could play R2=4 to further increase his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]And no matter where the central black chariot moves, red would threaten to play R-+3!||Black would be in trouble and aiming for a draw would become very difficult.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_36]Why this would not be ideal for black either...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_41]And red would be prepared to play R4+9 on the next move. ||In the ensuing battle, red would be faster than black in the attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_40]And black would still be in the game. It would too early to predict the outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_36]And red would be in trouble as black would be prepared to play K5=4 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_44]And it would be a drawish game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_33]no no no![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_34]And red would be in deep trouble as the all important central cannon would have no place to run!||Jim: If the red cannon budges from the central file, black would be prepared to gain material (horse + CHARIOT) with C8=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_34]And black would be prepared to retaliate viciously.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_34]And black's attack on the botom rank would be a big headache for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_31]And red would have an attack after offering another sacrifice. Red could be satisfied with this outcome.||And in actual competition, this would add further pressure to black's time as black would require more time to think off a better counter.||Black would try not to let this happen at all costs.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_31]Red could also choose to play A4+5.||Statistical data shows that black would do ok in this variation (should red play R6=8).[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]Another fashionable variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_26]And red would have a cross river pawn while black would have the positional advantage.||The game would become very complex and both sides would have immediate areas of concern to address.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_21]Not wise...[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_22]Black could also play E3+5 and after adjusting his  defensive formation, he would gain material back with the cannon skewer. Black would be better now as red's cross-river chariot is in a bad position and would require a few moves to place in better position again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_22]And black would have sacrificed material while gaining positional advantage.||Black would be prepared to play C8-1 on the next move as a continuation of his sacrificial play.||Sacrificing for control of the game is an often used tactic in this opening for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_16]And red would have a cross river pawn but the position of black's chess pieces would be better.||Both sides would have their areas of concern.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_16]
