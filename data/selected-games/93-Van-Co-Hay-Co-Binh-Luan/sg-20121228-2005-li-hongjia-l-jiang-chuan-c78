[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121228 2005 Li HongJia L Jiang Chuan C78||???(??)??-???????????3?||ECCO:C78 ??????????????????||ECCO:C78 57 Cannons with 3rd pawn advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 1st,3rd Pawn advancement and right riverbank horse||||Jim: Found this on the internet, which is very relevant to the recent opening theory that I have been uploading the past few days. Commentary was provided by Master Ge WeiPu.||||This matchup occurred in 2005, and was one of the more exciting games in the last round of the �??????�QiXin Golf Cup.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Jim: Please refer to the lectures by GM Liu DianZhong for the moves up till now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Red opts for the steady approach to the game by adjusting his formation.||Red could also choose to play C7+3 which is probably the most commonly played variation nowadays.||And red could also consider R2+2.||Both moves would lead to very different attacking and defensive formations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]C4+7 is not advisable now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]H3-2 would be to red's favor now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Red could consider C7=8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Black could consider playing H8+6 now as it would allow development of this horse and also protect the pawn on the 7th file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Red should have moved H8+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]Red should not play H4+3 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]Red cannot be greedy and play H3-5 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]GOOD MOVE!||After this exchange offer, black's game would take off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]Red CANNOT accept the offer of exchanging horses now![/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]And black tries to keep things complicated with this move to seek for a better chance of winning.[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]And red is forced to give up his cross river pawn to prevent black's elbow horse from attacking again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]At this point in time, black has a tiny advantage with the extra side pawn.||Red cannot play C4-4 now or black would increase his advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment80]And after the elephant is retreated to the baseline, red is sure to lose the central pawn.||Black has just made another major breakthrough in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment83]H6+4 would not be better for red either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment87]And red makes a rash decision with this move.||This would result in black moving P9+1 to corner the side elephant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment100]Black should have played C+=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment107]C8=2 would not make things easier for red either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment107]
[DhtmlXQ_comment118]And black's humble pawn manages to crack red's defense![/DhtmlXQ_comment118]
[DhtmlXQ_comment144]And the game would basically have been simplified into a sure win situation for black.||Black's 1h2c1tp is a sure-win against red's 1h2c1e.||Both players fought for another 20 more moves before red resigned at move 99.[/DhtmlXQ_comment144]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_108]And red would still have a hard time trying for a draw, as he would have no elephants to help defend now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_108]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_100]Better move suggested![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_101]Master Ge's suggested moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_101]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_108]And black would not be far from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_108]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_89]And red would still have a slim chance of forcing a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_84]And red would still have a hard time![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_76]And black would have a bigger advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_63]And the game would become drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_61]Not appropriate now![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_68]And black would have the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_65]NO NO NO!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_66]And red would NOT be able to resolve black's impending C2=6 checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_58]And black would be prepared to launch a scathing attack on red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_54]And black would be prepared to move C2=6 on the next move for an attack on red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_49]This way, red could play C7-7 to defend his own throat rank against the black elbow horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_35]This is a more aggressive approach by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_36]Moves suggested by Master Ge.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_53]And red would have the initiative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_39]And the game would quickly become a chariotless match. Red would be better as he would have better positioning of the chess pieces and should have an easier time as the game progresses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_34]And although red had gained an advisor, the position of his chess pieces are perilous.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_34]
