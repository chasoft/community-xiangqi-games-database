[DhtmlXQ_comment0]20120315 2010 cnsc Round 9||Wang Ruixiang L Zheng Yihong||Wang Ruixiang is a relative new comer.||This is one of the longest game that I have translated and annotated. ||The game goes back and forth and then back and forth and then back and forth again...whew.||Praise must be given to the two players for playing such an exciting game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Wang Ruixiang is a relative new comer. GM Zheng Yihong opted to use this opening to prevent playing the more familiar openings that Wang might have studied and had flying daggers prepared.||GM Zheng Yihong chooses to delay the battleground till midgame with this opening.||The Opposite Direction Cannons was once popular in the 1980's but has gradually fallen out of favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This is one of the ways that red can play.||A more aggressive approach would be to play R2+6 and it would be filled with fireworks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]C8+4 is another option, so that the opening can be directed back toward the more popular left cannon blockade opening for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And if black accepts the the offer, red would have  increased his lead and have a one move advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Although it seems that black can be satisfied with this outcome, red's R8+6 is very aggressive. Wang does not care about black playing R4=7 and shows his determination with this move. ||E3+1 would be the move to make if red opted for a more stable formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Post-game commentary suggested that this was not very ideal.||When playing the ODC, you tell your opponent that you are going to fight tooth for tooth. By playing C5-1 just does not seem to conform to the spirit of the ODC. (post game commentary by Master Huang Hailin and GM Zhao Xinxin, not me...LOL). The commentary went on to state that whichever side is not brave or fearless enough would suffer losses...[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Post game analysis suggests that this is the first move that leads to red's downfall.||At this stage, red's third file is much superior than black's formation, hindering the development of black's left flank. By playing this move, red actually surrenders this advantage to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]It is obvious that after losing the pawn on the 3rd file, he is suddenly under attack and has surrendered his lead to black.||With this exchange of chariots, it can seen that red hopes for a draw now as the game enters a chariotless midgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]At this stage, both sides have equivalent material but the position of all the black pieces are much better than red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And entering midgame, the positions of the black pieces have just become better. The horses that black have would be worth more than the cannons that red have should the game enter endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Red tries to hold on to his last lifeline. If the central pawn is lost, everything is lost.||Red also tries to set a trap for black...[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]and black does NOT take the central pawn!||This is because GM Zheng has seen through red's intentions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Another controversial move from red.||Red throws himself into the pits again with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Red thinks that black's P5+1 is to block the red horse to allow himself to play P7+1, so he reacts with E1+3. ||But GM Zheng has a surprise in store...[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]And all of tha sudden, red's defenses fall apart...[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Ouch...Red is forced to play this move.||Click on the variation to see the catastrophe that would follow should he play K5-1[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And red is still unable to prevent the powerful central pawn from advancing forward.||Red's days are numbered... or is it so...?[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]At this stage, black has the huge advantage and is poised to win the game...||BUT, perhaps the GM let his guard down and played this move, giving red a chance to redempt himself![/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment87]After a series of moves, red has pinned 3 of black's pieces on the pawn rank with one cannon.||The poor position of the black king is another cause of worry. At this stage, one would think that perhaps a draw was possible![/DhtmlXQ_comment87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment90]Black retreats the horse to protect the all important central pawn.||However, although black has 3 more effective pawns than red, all his pieces are now pinned, and it would stil be some time before black is able to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment90]
[DhtmlXQ_comment91]And red makes another fatal mistake, tilting the game in the other direction again.||Post-game commentary states that red is trying to for a draw now and with this move he attempts to delete the material advantage that black has.||However, in his haste, he plays this move.||C4+3 would have been a much more aggressive move. As it would still be some time before the black pawns cross the river, there would be no need to try to take them out now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment91]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]Ouch, time trouble causes GM Zheng to play this move instead of P7+1![/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]And black is forced to give up the advantage he has built up thus far.[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment103]And red continues to try to force a draw by offering this exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment103]
[DhtmlXQ_comment111]And at this point in time, the chances for a draw are very high.||The game is now a test of endgame prowess for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment111]
[DhtmlXQ_comment115]And Red makes a mistake with this move.||Post game commentary suggests that Red has not fully comprehended the key points of this endgame.||The top priority should be to prevent the black 7th pawn from crossing the river. Red was rash to play this move.||Perhaps he thinks that he could go for a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment116]And black recollects himself after losing the huge advantage he had.||A very good play from black, disallowing E9+7![/DhtmlXQ_comment116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment128]And after crossing the river, suddenly, black's chances of a win increase exponentially.||Red's future looks dim. If red were to force a draw, it would take a lot of hard work![/DhtmlXQ_comment128]
[DhtmlXQ_comment139]Red tries to prevent the black cannon from maneuvering to the other side...[/DhtmlXQ_comment139]
[DhtmlXQ_comment153]Ouch again...||That ouch is not only for red's missed attempt at a win, but also for my aching fingers and eyes...||PS: The above moves were less than half the actual number of moves played...[/DhtmlXQ_comment153]
[DhtmlXQ_comment162]After GM Zheng had calmed down and recollected, his shows great Xiangqi kungfu with the adjustment of his defenses over the past few moves.||Slowly, he tilts the game in his favor with these moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment162]
[DhtmlXQ_comment171]And after the past few rounds, black has slowly increased his lead again.||Unknowingly, black has pinned red again and is slowly maneurvering his pawns forward for the final kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment171]
[DhtmlXQ_comment180]GM Zheng shows great patience and after a flurry of punches, he knocks out the red pawn, thereby ensuring a definite win now![/DhtmlXQ_comment180]
[DhtmlXQ_comment196]Finally, after approaching 100 moves, black makes a definite charge![/DhtmlXQ_comment196]
[DhtmlXQ_comment216]A better move would be P6+1 using that pawn to exchange for 2 advisors.||The position of the red horse is undesirable, and black would have gained speed in attacking.||This central cannon move is a more steadfast move.||Perhaps time trouble has lead black to play more cautiously.[/DhtmlXQ_comment216]
[DhtmlXQ_comment224]Theoretically, by moving the black cannon here, black could play H9-8 to attack the other horse and then concentrate his forces on red's right flank.||However, post game commentary suggests that black has actually made a big mistake, albeit unnoticeable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment224]
[DhtmlXQ_comment244]And both sides take a breather. The clock is still clicking on![/DhtmlXQ_comment244]
[DhtmlXQ_comment259]According to the rules, there was a 60 move limit on repetitive moves.||Black was able to control the red pieces but red hung on and fought voraciously.||Time is running out for black and he needs to capture material or the game would be ruled a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment259]
[DhtmlXQ_comment268]For fear of the 60 move limit coming to an end, and that red has smartly maneuvered his horse out of a corner, black is forced to exchange his pieces so that a new 60 move limit could occur.||However, his remaining black pawn is now a low pawn and it would greatly increase the difficulty required for a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment268]
[DhtmlXQ_comment277]And suddenly, after the red horse has been able to return to the center to help defend, a drawish game situation arises , again...[/DhtmlXQ_comment277]
[DhtmlXQ_comment299]This time, time pressure causes red to make a mistake.||H3-5 would have defended nicely![/DhtmlXQ_comment299]
[DhtmlXQ_comment311]Ouch again...||The final move, I swear, that causes red the game.||Heartbreaking for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment311]
[DhtmlXQ_comment312]And black steals the game with this move...||Red resigns.||If red H5-3, black would checkmate with P5+1.||The red cannon cannot move and the last movable piece for red would be A6-5, whereby the red horse would be lost. The endgame would then be simplified now to a SURE WIN situation.|| Black wins this one after a hard fought battle.||This game has gone back and forth but red has shown superb resiliency with a never give up attitude while black shows the patience steadfastness of a GM.[/DhtmlXQ_comment312]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_226]And black would be still in total control.||Red would still have a very hard time defending.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_226]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_153]This should have been the move played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_153]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_161]And red would have captured an elephant free of charge, increasing his chances of a draw, and allowing me to rest my cramped fingers.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_161]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_115]This would be a better move. ||Red could play E7+5 to link up the elephants, providing even better defence and also denying further thec chances of a black win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_107]And black would have a hard time ensuring the survival of ALL his pawns.||If the game were to be simplified to that of 1h1p2a1e vs 1h2p2a2e, black would still have a chance of winning but the game would drag on and given the fact that time is running out, anything could happen.||This is why GM Zheng refused the exchange, hoping that the presence of a cannon could still turn the tables in his favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_107]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_95]And compared to the actual moves played, red gains an additional advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_95]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_80]And black could play it safe first with this move. ||After all, the pawn superiority has almost guaranteed a win now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_55]The following moves were added by me to show why red CANNOT take the central black pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_57]And the cannon has no better place to move![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_60]ouch again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_58]black's game for the taking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_58]ouch...[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_52]And red would be in deep trouble. The black central pawn would get to cross the river!||In midgames where there are no chariots, any pawn that manages to cross the river is worth many times their weight in gold.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_55]And black is not too far from winning![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_57]again, black is now basically guaranteed a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_45]And red would still have a game going on.||Black cannot push P7+1 forward or red could easily capture it with H6+4 (attempting to check or even to go for a horse cannon checkmate with C1+5) followed by H4-3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_45]And red would have successfully pinned the black pieces with his two cannons.||Black would not have any more of an attack for the moment and red could start doing damage with his horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_31]Again, this move was suggested. ||Red could still have a game going on by forcing black to decide whether or not to exchange chariots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_33]And black is not without his worries.||The game would still be relatively even, although black seems to have an attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_27]Again, this elephant move was suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]Perhaps red was fearing black's 7th pawn advancement move.||But post game analysis suggested that it was more bluff than substance...[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_33]And black would be faced with a dilemma. ||Whether he plays R4=3 or moves the chariot away, the position of the black pieces are disheveled and disorderly. Either way, red would have securely held on to his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_23]This is the suggested move. Red should not have offered and exchange of chariots and should have attempted to defend his right flank from R4=7 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_27]And black's formation would be in a mess. Red would actually gain tempo and stability through this exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_22]And both players sides would be concentrating their forces on one of the flanks. This would be a more aggressive counter from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_22]
