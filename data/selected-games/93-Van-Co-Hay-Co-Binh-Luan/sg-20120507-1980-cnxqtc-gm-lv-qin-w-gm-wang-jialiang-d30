[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120507 1980 cnxqtc GM Lv Qin W GM Wang Jialiang D30||ECCO D30 Central Cannon without 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Left Cannon blockade with halfway opposite direction cannons||ECCO:D30 ??????????????||||This game was the one of the few boards that I found which was actually commented by GM Lv Qin himself. His comments are given in quoation marks. ||||"In the 1980 Team championships held in the first half of the year, teams were divided into three groups. In each group, players tried to earn points for their respective teams and only the top  four players of each group were able to advance into the 'A' group. ||After 11 rounds of fierce competition, I emerged as second place in my group and was able to take part in the next round.||Players in next round included Xiangi greats like Hu Ronghua, Yang Guanlin (Lv's mentor), Liu Dahua, Li Laiqun, Wang Jialiang, Xu Tianli, Chen Xiaokun, Zang Ruyi, Yan Mujiang, Hu Yuanmao and Li Richun. I was the youngest amongst all the players, and maybe because I had nothing to lose, I played without fear and for the first time in my life, I was able to defeat the likes of Hu Ronghua and Wang Jialiang.||This game was an epic battle which I played against GM Wang Jialiang."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]"Instead of playing R1=2, I decided to play this move instead, allowing me the flexibility of choosing between R1=2 or the R1+1 variation. This would allow me to be able to see what GM Wang had in store so that I could adjust my game accordingly. " ||For beginners, if red played R1+1, it could turn into the central cannon with ranked chariot and 7th file horse variation, which is less aggressive and has a more deliberate pace of game.||Playing R1=2 followed by R2+6 would lead to more aggressive variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]" And with this move, black chooses his counter: the halfway opposite direction cannons. ||Black signals that he is going for a more aggressive game and the moves that follow would be a cutthroat battle to try to control the lead. ||If Black had played E3+5 ..."||||Please click on the variation below to understand what the game might become should black play E3+5 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]"By playing the riverbank horse, red acts decisively. If red chose C8=9, the variations that follow would become much less obvious and more complex.||Both variations have their advantages and disadvantages..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]"Playing H7+6 seemed to be rash for black. It would result in irreparable losses for black. I believe that the best move for black would be to play C8-3 to chase the horse away and force an exchange of pieces..."||||Please click on the variation to see what GM Lv suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]"Because of black's H7+6 move at move 10, red seized the opportunity to exchange cannons, and to  place pressure on black's right horse with his left chariot. This forced black to retreat his chariot, thereby allowing red's P7+1. Red has slowly increased his lead in the game.||But black played correctly with H6+7. If black had played E5+3 instead... "||||Please click on the variation below to see what E5+3 is not advised...[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]"This should be the correct move to play. E5++3 is not advised!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]"In all the moves that black played, perhaps this move was the one mostly responsible for black's loss. Black should have played R4=3 instead..." ||||Please click on the variation to understand why R4=3 is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"By capturing the black cannon, red gains material, and solidifies his game. Victory is not far away!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment82]"Black is forced to give up his advisor." ||Please click on the variation to see why black has to forego the advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment88]Or R6+1 would checkmate with the Angler horse checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment88]
[DhtmlXQ_comment93]" In retrospect, red's 3rd move of H8+7 deliberately tried to change the order of the moves played, so that the game would become complex. ||Black's 10th move (H7+6) opened up a hole in his defense, whereby red took advantage off mercilessly. From then on, it was a downhill battle for black.||After defeating such a strong opponent, my confidence when playing against other competitors of similar caliber was greatly increased. ||But in this competition, I came in 8th place despite my efforts. It also told me that I had still had a long road ahead."[/DhtmlXQ_comment93]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_82]naw...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_85]"And red gains an advisor with this move. This would guarantee a victory for red now." ||||For beginners, I have added my variation fo the moves that might have followed to show why red is guaranteed victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_89]and this would be an eventual win for red also.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_50]"And Black would still have a chance of gaining back lost material. There would still be chances of a draw."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]" And black would be prepared to gain back lost material and hinder red's attack at the same time..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]" and red would be attacking black from all directions! Black's situation would get from bad to worse."[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]"And it would still be a relatively even game. Neither sides would have the significant advantage."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_16]"And it would be a relatively even game for both sides."[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_16]
