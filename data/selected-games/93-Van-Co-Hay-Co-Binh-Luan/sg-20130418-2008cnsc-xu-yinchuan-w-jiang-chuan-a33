[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130418 2008cnsc Xu YinChuan W Jiang Chuan A33     ???????||ECCO:A33 ??????????||ECCO:A33 Elephant with rt proper horse vs Left Cross Palace Cannon.||Jim: From GM Jiang Chuan's book <<????>>, one of the better manuals in the last few years. Commentary was provided by GM Jiang himself.||Both players are considered the best in the recent few years.||This is a short game, but the comments by GM Jiang allows a peek into the minds of the GMs.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]If one were to study the games played by GM Xu, one would all sorts of openings and counters. It shows his depth and explains why he is such a hard opponent to beat.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This would be one of the more commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]A proactive move to get the major pieces out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]I made this move hoping to get off the beaten track. ||It would not be as aggressive as R2+6 to fully utilize the inherent power of the cpc. R2+6 would also add more pressure on red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Red has not played C8+4 for the past few moves. Perhaps it was because he was wary of black's possible C4+5 counter and chose to take things one at a time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]C1-1 would mean that red's plans to attack black's seventh file would have been disrupted.||Black could counter with R2+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]A natural move to make to keep things balanced.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]This was quite a cramped situation, but red was making full use of the slight advantage that he had to control and dictate the game in his favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]As can be seen, black's moove would show that he lost his cool.||Red's formation was very strong and stable and this move was rather risky in retrospect.||Advancing the cannons to pester red's chariot and horse would seem foolish, and I would have had to pay the price for it soon.||I had dismissed the fact that red's chariot was not pinned to its current spot and was able to move,therefore it was not prone to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]A pawn sacrifice!!!||A brilliant move under such cramped conditions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]And this was another fake move. It might seem aggressive looking but red had nothing to fear.||I should have played E5+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And GM Xu shows a textbook example of how to attack and capture the cannons that had been advanced for no real purpose.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And black has now fully appreciated his previous folly and was regretting his plans.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]As can been seen, red's pawn rank has been tightly guarded and patrolled. This would further deny a target for black to attack, and would make black's situation to go from bad to worse![/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Black sees that it was futile to prevent the red cannon from retreating to attack while at the same time prevent red's chariot from attacking, and resigned.||Red wins.   ||Jim: Still trying to appreciate the GM's comments. But I hope it has given you as much inspiration as it had given me![/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And black would be sure to lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_45]And I would still have been able to hold on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]And red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]
