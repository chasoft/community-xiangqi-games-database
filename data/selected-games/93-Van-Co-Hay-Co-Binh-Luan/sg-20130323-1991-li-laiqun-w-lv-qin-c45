[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130323 1991 Li LaiQun W Lv Qin C45||||ECCO:C45 ?????????????????||ECCO:C45 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement  and Pawn Ranked Chariot vs Screen horse defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation.||Jim: Another file from the internet. The commetator is unknown but it is quite a nice game.||||In 1990, Li LaiQun came in first runner up int he National Championships and became champion again in 1991. However, perhaps the most memorable battle that Li had in 1991 was the one played against Lv Qin in March's "???" ('?'=Terrapin ? Cup). It was an XiangQi champions match and this was the 6th round. Lv and Li had the same record of 1W1L2D. In order to advance, Li must win and if he drew this game, Lv would take red in the 6th game. There was no way out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Retreating the chariot to his pawn rank was the first time that Li had used in this competition.||The main idea was to prevent falling into any traps that Lv might have prepared. [/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]This is a continuation of R4-5.||Otherwise, any other move would not allow red to hold on to control of the game as easily. [/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]C2=7 might be a possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]If both players drew this game, Lv Qin would take red in the next one.||That is why Li LaiQun decided to advance his pawn forward, trying to keep the game complex so that he would still have his chances.||If he wanted to less volatility, he could have played H7+9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42] A very important defensive move, or red would checkmate quickly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57] And red takes his chances for an attack.||With this move, he destroys black's defenses.||This would prove to be the deciding move in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]And red is sure to win now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment109]Red wins.[/DhtmlXQ_comment109]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And red would have the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]And black would still have his chances for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
