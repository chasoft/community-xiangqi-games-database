[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130426 2007 Zhou XiaoPing W Jiang Chuan C73||???????????3?||||ECCO:C73 ??????????????????||ECCO:C73 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 1st,3rd Pawn Advancement with Right Riverbank Horse Variation. ||Jim: This was from a file found on the internet.||Red is amateur XiangQi king Zhou XiaoPing who is very well known in XiangQi circles.||Black was Master Jiang Chuan (who would later become National Champion and attain GM status).||Zhou, although a non-professional player, has a track record of defeating many professional Masters and GMs alike.||This board was interesting in the fact that Master ??Xie Kui and GM ???Liu DianZhong had both commented.|| ||Xie: This was the 5th round in the �???�ChenGuang Cup.||Famed ShanXi XiangQi player Zhou XiaoPing took on Master Jiang Chuan for this match.||In this game, although Master Jiang took black, he was very aggressive and refused to draw.||Red's Zhou took advantage of his in depth study of the opening to gain an advatage whereby he slowly increased it until a brilliant kill sufficed.||Let us enjoy this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Xie: This move shows us the determination that Black's Master Jiang had for the game.||If black played P1+1, red would be still slightly better but black would still be able to hold on.||Liu: Black had chosen a less commonly seen variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Liu: Red advances his chariot across the river to prevent black from forming a blockade.||And black chose the palcorner cannon to prepare for red's aggressions. A nice to and fro.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Xie: This is a seldom seen move. This must have spawned from Zhou's understanding and interpretation of this opening. More often than not, C7+2 would be played.||Liu: An ingenious approach to this opening, filled with creativity and depth.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Liu: red would have an attack if black chose A6+5. instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Xie: And black chose the miser's approach, refusing to give up material, however slight it may be.  R3+1 would be to red's advantage.||Liu: Jiang surely would not want a draw in this game. This is natural for a professional player when he goes up against an amateur.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Liu: C8=7 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Xie and Liu: C8=7 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Liu: Good move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Liu: Black would have gained a chariot and be sure of a win if red chose to play C5=7 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Liu: Red's would be left with no attack if he chose to play C5=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Xie:Good move!!! Red sacrifices his cannon in this move and demonstrates his precision in attack coupled with deep understanding of the game.||Red has laid the foundations for victory very firmly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]Liu: And this is the defense that red had thought up off a long time ago! Brilliant![/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]And black resigned!||Liu: Jiang had forced his moves in midgame, while Zhou had shown great precision in his endgame technique to have done well. Being to win Jiang Chuan in a game of XiangQi is hard thing to do!||Jim: For beginners, red threatens to checkmate with R2=4 and black has no answer for that.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]Liu: And after the chariots are exchanged, red's attack would be no more.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]And black would be sure to capture the red chariot and thus win!||Jim: Black is now threatening to checkmate with C7+9![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]And red would seem to have an easier time in the game to follow.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]And red would have an attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
