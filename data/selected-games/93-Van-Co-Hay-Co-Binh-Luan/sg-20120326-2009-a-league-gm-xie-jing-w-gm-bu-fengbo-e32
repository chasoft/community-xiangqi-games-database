[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120326 2009 A League GM Xie Jing W GM Bu Fengbo||ECCO E32 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation||ECCO:E32 ???????????????||This game was found at the following url http://www.zgxqds.com/zixun_info.asp?id=30326 ||It was played in 2009 in an A League Comepetition, unfortunately, the name of the competition was not known.||GM Xie Jing (one of the youngest GM to date and the last disciple that Legendary GM Hu Ronghua accepted) goes up against GM Bu Fengbo.||The annotations of this game were given by Master Ge Weipu ??? in his collection of commented games in 2009. �2009???????????????�.Master Ge Weipu is the auther of MANY MANY books of high quality. ||However, in this game, the file I found on the net at the above url showed some serious flaws in the moves given. I have opted to show the original moves given.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]For beginners,||although red plays his right cannon as the central cannon and black plays his right elephant, ECCO deems this as the left central cannon variation for red, and the left elephant variation for black. This is because, ECCO deems P3+1 as the opening move for the Angel's pawn opening by default.||A slight flaw in the system... LOL.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]At this stage in the game, the development of red's chess pieces are faster but black has the cross river pawn. ||It would be relatively even at this stage for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is a less played variation for red!||E7+5 is the more commonly played move. ||Another game with a similar opening was played in the same year, whereby Heilongjiang Province's Master Nie Tiewen lost to Guangdong Province's Zhang Xuechao.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Another game played with the same opening was found in another competition called "?????"||, one of the A League competitions, in 2009.||GM Jiang Chuan took red and lost that game to GM Zhuang Yuting. ||Please click on the variation below to see the game played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Playing H8+9 by black is an improvement.||In 2007, during a match played in the �????, another A league competition, GM Xie Jing went up against Master Zhang Qiang with the same opening. ||In that game, Master Zhang Qiang did not move H8+9, instead, he played P2+1.||However, there seemed to be a recording mistake in the commentary for it would be impossible to play the moves given. If anyone has that game, please email it to me!||||...       ?2?1,||????,?2?1,||????(wrong move recorded...),?3?1,||????,?8?9,||????,?9?8,||????,?8?6,||????,?8?6,||????,?8?6,||????,?2?4,||????,?4?3,||????,?6?3,||????,?6?5,||????,?5?6,||????,?5?1,||????,?9?7,||????,?5?4,||????,???1,||????,?????||The comments given in that game were that GM Xie gained a huge advantage in that game with his sacrifice. I hope to be able to find that game to see the actual moves played![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]After eliminating the black cross river pawn, red has increased his lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Ouch, another mistake found in the commentary ...||Master Ge suggested P3+1 ...but the moves given in the board that I found are impossible to continue. I will try to see if I can find that book in the bookstores tomorrow!||Again I have added the moves for you to see! ||||P3+1 ...??????,???8?7,||???? (wrong move recorded!),?5?6,||????,?7?2,||????,?7?1,||????,?7?6,||????,?7?6,||????,?3?4,||????,?5?3,||????,?????[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Red sacrifices his pawn to allow for development of his horse. Good move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]GM Ge suggested that it was a pity that black forgone his pawn.||P7=6 would have been better.||Please click on the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]And red gains the HUGE advantage and control of the game with this central cannon move!||Black's forces are inadequate to cause much trouble on red's right flank...[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]And black had to sacrifice his chariot to resolve red's R++3 checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]And GM Bu resigns![/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]And black would still have a good game going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]GM Jiang Chuan L GM Zhuang Yuting in 2009.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_42]And black can be very satisfied with his opening. ||GM Jiang Chuan L GM Zhuang Yuting in 2009.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_42]
