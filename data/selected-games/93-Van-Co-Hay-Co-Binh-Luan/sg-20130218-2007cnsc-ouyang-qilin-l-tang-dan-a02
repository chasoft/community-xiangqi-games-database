[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130218 2007cnsc OuYang QiLin L Tang Dan A02||||ECCO:A02 ???||ECCO:A02 Side/Edge Horse Opening||||Jim: Found this file over the internet. A female GM vs female GM match, back in 2007. It was the deciding match and whoever won the game would become the new Empress of XiangQi. Unfortunately, it was not known who had made the comments.||||||GM OuYang QiLin was the runner up in the 1992 and 1993 National Chinese XiangQi championships. After  a decade of waiting, she resumed her her old form and in this year's National Singles Championships and managed to enter the finals.||Young Tang Dan is one of the best players in the younger generation today.||This match was very important as it represented a match between two generations of XiangQi players. Also, whoever won the game would become the new Queen of Xiangqi.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]A coin was tossed and OuYang QiLin was to take red.||Choosing the side horse opening albeit unusual, also showed that OuYang's strategy was to place emphasis on the midgame and endgame instead of the opening. ||Under most circumstances, younger players would be more familiar with the various intricacies of the newer openings, while older players were stronger in midgame and endgame.||That was why OuYang decided to play the game to her strengths while at the same time attack young Tang's weakness.||The very first move is already a good demonstration of Chinese warfare strategy.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]In the past, H2+3 was more often played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]R9=4 is a possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]R2+7 is another alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Another possibility would be P7+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This is an unobvious weak move. It would give red a chance to attack.||R6+2 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]C5=4 would be better now as it would cover up black's inherent weakness on the board. It would still be a standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Nice move! Red has targetted black's folly of A4+5  (move 11) and has countered nicely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]H8+7 would also result in black having a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]And black's horse is done for. Red's chances of becoming champion greatly increased.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]H9+7 would have been much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]Red could also consider C7+4 and red would still have the material and positional advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]C7+4 would have been better!||If black tried to answer with K5=4, red could consider H8-7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment59]And red missed her chance.||She still should have played H7+9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]E1+3 would be suicidal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]And red made a mistake in attacking.||H7+5 would still have been to her advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]And this was the move that caused OuYang her championship. ||Red could only move C8=9 now or she would lose material. ||In the preceding moves, red missed many chances to close out the game, and slowly gave the game bit by bit to her opponent.||Although this had technical implications, this was more of a psychological problem for red. ||Red was cruising to victory, but perhaps the pressure resulted in her performing under par.||As can be seen, the psychological aspect is also a very important part when rating the skill of a player.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68] And black regains lost material.||All of a sudden, the scales tipped in black's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment79]C7-4 would have provided  a stronger defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment86]Red's king is poorly positioned. It would be hard for red to ward off black's attack with the chariot, cannon and pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment100]And red is bound to lose the advisor. Black is now in a winning position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment105]Red cannot capture the advisor or black would capture red's chariot/cannon with A4+5![/DhtmlXQ_comment105]
[DhtmlXQ_comment124]And red resigned.||A battle of two generations, with the younger player victorious. ||A new Empress of XiangQi is born, 17 year old Tang Dan from Beijing!||||Jim: Tang would go on to win the coveted cup many more times in the ensuing years![/DhtmlXQ_comment124]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_106]Jim: Black would now threaten to checkmate with K4-1, while at the same time threatening to capture the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_106]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_79]And this would have better for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_67]And although black would get a temporary breather, red would still have the significant advantage.||Black would still have a hard time trying even for a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_63]And red would capture the black horse for free!||Jim: If E3-5, red would mate with the double cannons, C7+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_63]And black would run out of steam. In the ensuing game, red would still be faster than black in the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_67]And red would be quicker to kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]And red would be prepared to simplify the game to her advantage with R4-5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_57]And red would have simplified the game such that she would have both the material and positional advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_51]And red would still have the obvious advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]And red would be prepared to play C3=1 on the next move. There would be many choices for red to attack and black would still have a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_41]And black would still be very passive.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]And black could choose to attack the central pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_24]And black would still have a playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_26]And black has made use of a pawn sacrifice in exchange for rapid development of material.||The game would become entangled and knotty but it would be still playable for both players.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_20]Or black could consider moving P7+1 with this move. Black would still have a playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_11]Another possible alternative[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_15]And the game would become very complex.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_15]
