[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121207 12AC Lv JinRu D Zhang GuoFeng A64||||ECCO:A64 ?????????||ECCO A64 Cross Palace Cannon with Filed Chariot vs  Left Central Cannon.||Another file from the internet. ||This game was played in the 12th Asia Cup whereby Lv JinRu from Chinese Taipei took out GM Zhang GuoFeng from JiangSu, China.||Commentary was provided by Master Song GuoQiang.||This seemed to be from one of the editions of <<??>> in 2003.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]The cross palace cannon was given the thumbs down in the Qing Dynasty ancient manual "The Plum Manual" by Wang ZaiYue. It seemed that playing the cross palace cannon for the first move would not be able to handle black's offenses if black chose the central cannon as a counter.||However, the cross palace cannon evolved and after  many players kept improving it, it has become a legitimate opening for red now, and is quite fashionable.||Other than black's central cannon counter, other commonly used counters would include H8+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Playing the riverbank cannon would seem to conservative. ||P7+1 would be a attack oriented move with a specific target.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Playing the left ranked chariot is one of the commonly used tactics against the cross palace cannon. The main idea is to link the chariots up and then breakthrough from the center.||The left ranked chariot would allow red's formation to be more balanced and allow more versatility for black, be it to defend or attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Pushing the red pawn forward would seem to be a natural move to play, but in fact, it would cost red the make one move less![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Weak move. H3+5 would be better!||Jim: Unfortunately, no explanation is given. Perhaps it would be that that black does not have any specific target to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]After over 10 moves, it is not hard to see that the female chess players from Chinese Taipei have greatly increased their level of play.||Playing A6+5 was too rash.||P3+1 to make room for the horses would be a better choice now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]A seemingly aggressive move, which is not practical at all.||R2+2 to threaten black's pawn rank would have been more practical.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]As can be seen, capturing the pawn would let the game become a drawish one.||E7-5 could be a viable alternative, as it would allow red to keep her options open.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]According to the AXF rules, a check followed by a threat to kill would be deemd ad a draw. ||Black would not be satisfied with this outcome and that is why black retreated her chariot to try  to keep the game alive.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment76]At this stage, the game is basically a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]Draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_40]And red would not gain much after the exchange.||Jim: Black, on the other hand, would now have an aggressive horse ready to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_15]This is not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]And red's left flank would be congested. Black would have more room to move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]And red's major pieces have all moved. Red would still be able to control his lead better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_8]Master's Song's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]And after the change in formation, black could still be satisfied.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]
