[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120323 25th 5 rams cup Xu Yinchuan W Lv Qin||ECCO: C49 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement with Central Pawn variation vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||ECCO:C49 ?????????????????||This game was played in the 25th 5 Rams Cup in 2005. It was the 5th Round and Guangdong team colleagues GM Xu Yinchuan and GM Lv Qin go at each other. The two know each other's style of play like the back of their hands.||In this game, GM Xu plays an aggressive variation right from the start but the game slowly cools down in midgame...until GM Xu sacrifices a horse for GM Lv's advisors, thereby throwing the game into chaos before finally winning!||||Commentary was given by the great North East Tiger, GM Wang Jialiang (GM Zhao Guorong's sifu...)[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]And GM Xu chooses this very complex variation. This is also one of the fiercest and aggressive red variations and is a favorite of aggressive players. ||It is quite out of the ordinary for GM Xu who is more known for his subtle but lethal play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Pushing the pawn forward consecutively has been gradually used with increasing frequency by red.||GM Wang noted that in 2004, in the National Singles Competition, it was often used creatively.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Advised move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Moving the elephant now is part of black's game plan.||Please see the interesting variation that GM Wang suggested by clicking on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]H7+5 is another alternative but red would still have a hold on the game[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Black exchanges his horse for the cannon. GM Wang guessed that GM Lv made this move to decrease the attacking potential of red's remaining chess pieces.||R8-3 is usually played but black could counter with C8+2! C8+2 was a relatively new variation and perhaps GM Lv wanted to avoid this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]!!! Brilliant move!||After the exchange, red ensures that he will not lose. This is a trademark of GM Xu's style. It also forces black into an interesting predicament. Although black has 2 chariots, they are not very functionable after the exchange!||You will see why![/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]R8=9 is another alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]In the previous few moves, red sees how black would react, hoping to pry open black's defenses but black handles everything calmly and nicely.||It is now that the side pawn suddenly has a game changing effect![/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment71]All hell breaks loose with this sacrifice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment72]GM Wang suggests that GM Lv was hotheaded when he made this move. R4-3 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment80]Black's predicament would not be resolved even if he played K6=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment83]Brilliant move from red!||Black two chariots are pinned indirectly with this move. GM Xu is not far from victory now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]Black cannot salvage his game even if he played K5=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]GM Lv sees that it is futile to continue and resigns! ||||When the tournament ended, GM Xu was crowned king.||2nd to 4th place belonged to GM Liu Dianzhong, Hong Zhi and Yu Youhua in that order.[/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_87]And black would still lose![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_81]and black would still be in deep trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_81]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_72]This was the move suggested by GM Wang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_73]And these were the moves suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_84]Black would still be on the receiving end but would not lose so fast. And the double chariots could[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_65]GM Wang suggests this as another alternative for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_71]and red would have the pawn advantage and stil be winning the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_28]A possible alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]The following were the moves suggested by GM Wang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]It would not be advisable to play K5=4 now...||Please click on the variation below to understand why..[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]And red would still be the aggressor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]and black would have the better attacking chances![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]Uh-oh....[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]And although red sacrifices his left chariot, his attack is more than what black can handle![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]This variation was once played...[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]And although red has two cross river pawns, his left flank is relatively undeveloped. This would be a major cause of concern and there would be plenty of chances for black to seize the initiative from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]
