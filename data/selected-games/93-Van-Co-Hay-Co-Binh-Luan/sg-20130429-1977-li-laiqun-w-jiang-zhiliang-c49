[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130429 1977 Li LaiQun W Jiang ZhiLiang C49||||ECCO:C49 ?????????????????||ECCO:C49 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement and Pawn Ranked Chariot vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Jim:This was a commented file found over the internet. Very interesting stuff.||It also shows the beginning of the path to becoming a GM for Li LaiQun, one of the most revered figures in XiangQi for all time.||This was the game that let the whole XiangQi universe take note of him. The match was held on 1977-03-21.||||To allow Li LaiQun to gain exposure and increase his experience outside of HeBei province, in March 1977, the Atheletic Commision of HanDan, HeBei province held a friendly for competitors from BeiJing, HeBei, GuangDong, and AnHui province. Big names like GM Cai FuRu, Jiang ZhiLiang, Liu Xing participated. ||This was Li's first ever participation in an event of this magnitude and he won the event in style with a record of 17W1L. And in the competition, his win over Jiang ZhiLiang shook the XiangQi world.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Jiang ZhiLiang was the runner up in the 1975 Chinese National Singles Championships and he did it in style by not conceding any game. He was one of the most prominent XiangQi stars after the Cultural Revolution.||At the time of the competition, his was at his peak and was the hand-down favorite to win the tournament. [/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Jim: Charging the central pawn forward.||This was and still is one of the most commonly played variations for this opening. Very aggressive. ||The young Li showed his determination.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]This was a conflict in strategy for black.||R8+8 and P7+6 were played for black to attack the elephant. Playing H7+5 would have gone against this plan.||A better move would have been E3+5 for black, fortifying the center and wait for red to move an elephant to the center. Black would then be prepared to play R8=2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Although black would seemed to be sure to gain material, black had also given up pinning red's left flank and would be slower than red in developing his material. [/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And the young Li chose to attack black's relatively empty left flank. The start of a brilliant kill.  [/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Another brilliant move.||Traversing the pawn would allow red's king to actually control the central file![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Another brilliant move. ||This would be like the growling of thunder in the horizon. ||Red saw his chance and played decisively. [/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Jim: For beginners, red had threatened to mate with R4+3, and that is why black had to move the pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And red's combination of 1r1h1c have obtained the best possible positions on the board.||Red would now be prepared to launch his final attack.||Black shows aggression too and tries to attack.||This would be the start of an all out fistfight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]!!!||After this move, all possibilites of a black retaliation are snuffed. Both of black's chariots are left to try to defend...in vain. [/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Jim: YET ANOTHER sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]And this is a continuation of the chariot sacrifice on move 20.||The end is near for black!||Red's chariot would now prove his worth.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Jim: Black was forced to countersacrifice or R8+6 would mate. But it would still be too late.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]And red won the game as black resigned.||Jim: There would be no way to resolve red's angler horse and chariot combination kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
