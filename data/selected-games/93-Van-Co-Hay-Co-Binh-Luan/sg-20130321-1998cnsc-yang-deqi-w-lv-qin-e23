[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130321 1998cnsc Yang DeQi W Lv Qin E23||||ECCO:E23 ???????????????||ECCO:E23 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon Variation vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation||||Jim: An interesting game found over the net. Commentary was by someone with the nick of ????. Nice and very poetic commentary!||||||In the 7th round of the 1998 Chinese National Singles Competition, XiangQi Master Yang DeQi squared off against defending champion Lv Qin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Yang started the game with the subtle Angel's Pawn, and after Lv answered with the Thundering Defense, Yang countered with the Central cannon variation.||This was to prevent Lv from playing the screen horse defense where he was very familiar with. ||Yang shows that he had come prepared going into this battle. [/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This would seem to be a foolish move, but in fact, it shows that Yang is prepared to go for the kill. ||In the earlier stages of the game, the onlooker can feel the pressure already starting to build up.  [/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]GM Lv does not fall for red's tempt.||He continues with his plan and plays R9=2 to develop his chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]A well thought out move by Yang, prying for chances to attack.||In the recent years (Jim: back in the 90's), Yang was especially fond of the Angel's pawn and had achieved a good track record with it. ||Playing the cross riverbank chariot now is the start of a series of well planned attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]In this match, Lv did not have adequate time to prepare. It would seem that Lv had miscalculated his situation and chose a less than desirable variation.||By pushing the edge pawn foward, black actually encourages red to move his chariot to the central files.   ||C8=6 would have been better, as black would now protect his rib file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And red chose A4+5 over A6+5. This would set black up and prepare him for the impending kill, now that his chariot is on the 4th file. [/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]It would seem that Lv's chariots have progressed and advanced nicely in the game, while at the same time provided adequate defense.||However,in reality, it is Yang who has the advantage as he has all his important pieces in place and ready to launch a powerful attack.||Lv made a nonchalant move with R2=3 and he would have to pay dearly in the ensuing game. This is not a good move as it allows red's left chariot to be developed. Once the left red chariot is able to get out, red would increase his hold of the game quickly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]As red's chariot on the 4th file has a potential iron bolt checkmate waiting, red pounces on the chance to develop his left chariot. ||Once this chariot is moved to the 8th file, it would be able to coordinate an attack with red's central cannon.||If one were to look at the board again, red has already controlled the 4th, 5th and 6th files! The central cannon is menacing while red's palcorner cannon has caused much trouble for the black chariot and prevented black's king from K5=4.||Now, together with red's chariot on the 8th file, red is prepared to launch the final attack.||Black on the other hand has cramped pieces and are not very organized.||Master Yang grew up in the bay of BoHai?? and is very familiar with the ways that ocean waves are able to 'attack' the shores over and over again. ||He uses this philosophy in this game brilliantly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Red's rib chariot starts the attack by attacking the weakest link in black's defense. [/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Lv does not seem to have appreciated the extent of red's impending attack and advances his horse instead.It shows his displeasure in the game, after being on the receiving end for so loing.||Perhaps it would have been better to play the following variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]With C6=5, red adds power to his attack on the center.||E7+9 would deny black any chance of a possible attack, and after that is done, red can attack without fear.||R8+9 would also force the black chariot back to defend and thus allow red to control the throat rank with both his chariots.||Red's attack is like an angry dragon rising to the  skies, ready for the final kill.||Red would now threaten to kill with C+=3! to attack both elephants for the kill.||One can only give praise for Yang's farsightedness .[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And Lv must have been affected by Yang's aggressiveness and decided to use his horse to exchange for one of the central cannons, hoping to save the day.||Black should have played P7+1 to prevent red's C5=4 as it would throw a wrench in red's attack for the time being. It would also prevent the red horse from attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Another lethal mistake.||This would allow red's horse to attack black's central elephant which would mean the beginning of the end.||C8+2 to slow red's horse would be much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]And black's king is forced to abdicate his throne, looking aged and vulnerable.||But this would also be black's strongest counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Red's chariots have been attacking viciously, gaining an elephantin the process.||Black's king looks increasingly vulnerable.||And the stage is now set for the final kill and the game is gradually pushed to a climax. [/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]And red does not forget to defend.||After E9-7, black would not have any more threat of an attack.  ||R7+3 would be too rash for red now![/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]And this is the move that would cost black the game.||C5=6 or C8=7 would have been better. [/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]And red would now make his final move, controlling the central file.||Black's defense is in pieces and they would crumble soon under red's merciless attack.||Black would not be able to get himself out of this predicament now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment89]And red wins.||Reviewing this game, it would seem that Lv had been anesthesized by red's R2+5 early in the game and was not fully aware of red's intentions.||Red on the other hand, grew from strength to strength, and after a fierce fight, manages drown black in his attack , wave after wave.[/DhtmlXQ_comment89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]Or C8=7 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_79]And black would not be able to resolve red's checkmate threat.||Jim: I have added a few more moves to show the beginner why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_81]checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_81]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_83]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_77]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_77]checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_74]And black could still offer much resistance.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_80]And black would still hold on for his dear life.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_47]And black would lose the chariot and the game would be over.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]And black would have successfully undermined red's attack and would get to live another day.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_44]And black would have seized control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_44]And black would be better instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_38]And black must change his moves according the the Chinese rules.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_41]Although black would still be on the receiving end, it would be better that the actual outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_37]And although the advantage would still be red's, but black would still able to hang on in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_39]And red would be prepared to kill with R8=5.||Black would also have a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]And black would still have a playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_21]And although red had sacrificed early on, the blatant attack that he has gained in exchange is well worth it. ||That is why GM Lv did not play P3+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_25]And red would have a fierce attack ongoing after the sacrifice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_21]And red would gain back lost material, together with the advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_21]
