[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130128 12th5rc Xu TianHong w Li LaiQun D14||||ECCO:D14 ????????||ECCO:D14 Same Direction Cannons: Fr vs Sr||||Jim: Found this game on the net. This game was played in 1992, in the 12th ever 5 Rams Cup, which was considered to be of the highest level in XiangQi back then. Unfortunately, the competition is now defunct. ||Anyway, GM Xu TianHong took on GM Li LaiQun in this sdc match. Commentary was provided by ShangHai's Master Xu TianLi, who happens to be an International Chess Master too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Black advances the pawn before playing the ranked chariot to develop his horse while limiting red's horse for the slow variation of the same direction cannons. ||This variation first appeared in the 1970's and has slowly evolved to be a major opening system of its own.||Jim: GM Hu RongHua is credited for making this opening popular.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Another important variation is H8+9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And the opening is basically determined.||Red has used the Central cannon with Filed variation whild black has countered with the Slow (or Deferred) Chariot with Right pawn ranked cannon variation.||This is an important section stage in the opening. There are basically two options or strategies for red to pursue. ||For players who dislike too much excitement, he could choose to slow the tempo of the game, and also adopt a more subtle but versatile approach to the game with this H7+8 variation. It is also one of the more fashionable trends of playing this variation (Jim: that was about 20 years ago...). ||Another option would be H7+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]This would be one of the older ways of playing the opening. GM Li chose this variation because he had something up his sleeves?||R9+1 is the more fashionable way of playing this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And GM Li took a risk with this move. By playing the filed chariot for an exchange, black hopes to use his tempo in exchange for black's elephant and  a chance to attack.||In the 1991 National Singles Championships, Li had used this strategy three times and won in all those games. They were especially significant as he because National Champion for the fourth time that year.||However, a win does not necessarily mean that such a provocative variation was mature. His opponents were all different, with different standards of play. Some were prepared, some were not, and all of these factors would bring about different outcomes of this variation. ||In this year's 5 Rams Cup, Li had not done well early in the competition had started to become edgy. Li's opponent, GM Xu TianHong, was a no-nonsense, by-the-book type of player, who took things at his own pace. ||Faced with such opponent with such characteristics, that was perhaps why he tried this opening tactic again.||Unfortunately for Li, Xu was a master of strategical warfare and had been following Li's recent games. Xu would never have let this variation go uncontested.||Perhaps a more practical play would be R9+1 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And black is faced with a predicament.||Red is threatening with R6+6 and black's pieces are still relatively undeveloped.||Faced with such a dilemma, it would seem inevitable that black would be on the receiving end of things.||Black could try two other risky approaches to the game, but if red handled them correctly, black would still be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Red has control of the game and he knew it. That is why he patiently captured the pawn first, while maintaining keeping the lead in the game in a steafast manner.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]A single cannon with no reinforcement is unlikely to be of any function.||C7-7 to defend while waiting for a chance to attack would be better.||However, Li had tried to create chances but was not very succesful, and was not content with a draw. His frustrations showed in his play as they were not his usual self.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]If black played R1=2, red would counter with P7+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]A very versatile move from red!||By retreating the horse, red would now have the possibility of a cross river pawn, while at the same time be poised to attack the central pawn.||On a deeper level, this would also be an indirect pin on the black chariot as it is forced to defend the horse.||This would buy some time for red to start attacking black's empty left flank and this is when GM Xu started attacking![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Red has many targets to attack.||At this point in time, GM Xu does not hurry his moves but moves the king to safety. ||This is to prepare for an all out attack.||Black is in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Black has noted that red's horse would be capable of the elbow horse attack and that is why he decided to sacrifice his horse to allow his chariot to be able to defend.||However, a loss of material without any obvious compensation is still lethal.||In contrast, red is now one horse up, and decided to adopt a more steadfast approach. He slows black's attack down before preparing to making use of his material advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]Black cannot play A4+5![/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]Red wins the game.||Jim: GM Li resigned here. I have added a few more moves for the beginner to understand why black's situation is hopeless.[/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment87]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_87]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_87]And black would lose his chariot. Hopeless.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_83]And black would lose the chariot and the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_65]!!! And red is not far away from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]And black might have had a chance of a breather.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]And the red chariot would be ruthless and black would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]Red would still have the significant advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]And this variation would mean that black would have to sacrifice in order to try to create a counter attack. However, from the looks of things, it would seem that red would still be faster in attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_37]And red would have simplified the game and still hold on to a significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_33]And black's cannon would have nowhere to go.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_25]And black would lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_17]And although red would still control the tempo of the game, the game has slowed down and black would have plenty of time to react.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_31]And red would have the slight advantage with the pawn that has crossed the river.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_24]And both sides would be at it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_40]Red would have an extra elephant but black's pieces are very mobile and poised to attack.||Each would have his worries.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_23]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment16_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_26]And the game would become very complicated and volatile. ||For black, this is an acceptable option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_22]And the game would turn into a vicious fight.||Black would seem to be the better of the two.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_16]And black would have wrestled control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20_20]Black uses his chariot in exchange for two of red's pieces and has obtained the chance to counterattack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21_7]The following are the commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21_35]And red would be attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22_27]And red have gained control of the game after sacrificing the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23_33]Red has the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24_37]Red has the initiative firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25_18]Black would have formed a blockade on red's left flank and red would have trouble developing the chess pieces there.||Black would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25_18]
