[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120605 1981 Liu Xing L Bu Fengbo D29||ECCO D29 Same Direction Cannons: Filed Chariot vs Ranked Chariot||ECCO:D29 ???????||||Another very nice game I found on the internet played over 30 years ago.||Red is Shenzhen's Master Liu Xing who was a forced to be reckoned with in his hey day. Master Liu has defeated many Masters and GM's alike in his career. He now serves as one of the coaches and key players on the Shenzhen team today, together with Master Huang Yong who was initially from Hebei. ||GM Bu Fengbo is still very active on the Xiangqi scene, serving as head coach to the ShenYang team.||This game was nominated as the best same direction cannons game in 1981. Although the game was decided in 28 moves, it is nevertheless full of fireworks. It was also found in the periodical Qiyi, or rather the magazine that was found before Qiyi existed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]This pawn sacrifice variation was studied extensively by GM Wang Jialiang and the late GM Meng Liguo in their master piece on the same direction cannons�?????�many years ago. This book shaped the thinking and theory of the same direction cannons and had many indepth conclusions to this variation.||Now, if I recalled correctly, GM Bu Fengbo was a disciple of GM Meng, so it would be natural that he knew this variation like the back of his hand![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]This was an improvement over R6+3 which was the original move played for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Advacing the horse H5+4 or H5+6 have a world of difference!||Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]R6+3 is not advisable now![/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]After 21 moves, both players have arrived at this tightrope game. Black's E7+9 would seem rather nonchalant, but in fact it is a very good move!||Please click on the variations below. Very complex and very exciting![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]This move seemed controversial. ||Perhaps a better move would be E9+7 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]In retrospect, this was deemed as the move that lost the game for red.||P7+1 was suggested![/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And red resigned. There is no way that red could resolve black's H2+4 checkmate...[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_55]And red would have won the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_51]And red is guaranteed a victory![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_48]And black would be in control![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]not as good as E7+9![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_69]and it would be to red's advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_62]no![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_77]and red wins!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_52]and black would be better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]And red would be on the winning side![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]Although the moves that follow are very tight and exciting,with little room for error, it is not as good as H5+4![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_58]And after trading blow for blow a fistfight, the game would return to an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_58]
