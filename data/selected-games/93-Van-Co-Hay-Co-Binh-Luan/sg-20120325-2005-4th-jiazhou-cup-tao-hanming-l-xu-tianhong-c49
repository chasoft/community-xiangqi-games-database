[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120325 4th Jiazhou Cup Tao Hanming L Xu Tianhong||ECCO: C49 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement and Pawn Ranked Chariot with central pawn advancment variation vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge Cannon for Chariot exchange variation. ||ECCO:C49 ?????????????????||||This game was played in the 2005 Jiazhou Cup in Shandong county. Only active GMs were invited and was one of the highest level competitions in China.||After 3 days of fierce fighting, GM Xu Tianhong was crowned champion for the men's division.||The female's section was won by Heilongjiang's GM Wang Linna. ||Comments were provided by GM Zhuang Yuting.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]GM Xu shows his efforts in the study of this opening and hits GM Tao with a flying dagger in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]GM Zhuang Yuting noted candidly that GM Tao seldom used fashionable openings in competition. He guessed that GM Tao decided to use this opening (which was indeed very popular a few years back) to try to earn points. ||||Other commonly played variations include H8+7, C8=6 and H8+9... all of them with very complex variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]In the past few moves, GM Xu keeps testing Red's response. This was one of the most fashionable openings of the mid 00's.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]And GM Xu plays this move. ||Please refer to the annotated game on 20120324 whereby GM Liu plays the same move. ||In the past, P3+1 was played by black .||Red would counter with P7+1 and H7-5. But both variations were very complex and volatile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]GM Tao played this move to prevent H7+8 from red.||C5=6 is also another option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]GM Zhuang analysed that GM Tao played this move to  try to develop his left chariot. But he underestimated the potential of black's potential of counterattack.||C5=4 to readjust red's formation would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]GM Xu shows that he has prepared well with this series of moves. ||Drawing experience from similar games, GM Xu makes a sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]A6+5 would also be futile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Nice!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And red resigns. ||If red plays A5-4 to capture the black horse, red would win with R9=6. ||Black wins!||GM Xu Tianhong goes on to win the tournament.||I have added the following moves to show the beginner why..[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]and black would win soon![/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_60]And black would win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_55]This is to show the beginner why the black chariot is loaded with poison...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]Double check...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_58]mate[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_50]And red would be unable to handle black's throat cutting checkmate with R4=5 and then R7=6 on the next move. The kill would be essentially the same as in the actual game played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_62]Black wins![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]This was the move that was played in other games of the recent past.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_48]Possible moves...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_49]Nice!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_57]And red would have the winning game (C3+5 to check and capture the chariot)! If the cannon moves, an Angler Horse checkmate with R8+9 is possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_48]And Black would be better off if he played this move though...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]And at this stage, red would have the material advantage but black would have the positional superiority.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]and red would be better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]This was the move suggested by GM Zhuang Yuting.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_49]And it would still be a volatile game. Both red and black have desingated areas of attack and also  worrying areas of weaknesses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_49]
