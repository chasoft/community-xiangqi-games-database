[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121217 1965 cnsc Hu RongHua W Wang JiaLiang A28 ||???????||ECCO : A28 Elephant opening with Screen Horse Variation vs Left Central cannon||ECCO:A28 ??????????||Jim: Another file found on the internet. And a classic. Comments were given by GM Hu himself, with exerpts from GM Wang's diary...||||2003/10/8 Wed Fair Weather||Regarding this battle, Wang JiaLiang had mentioned in his memoirs:||" At the blink of an eye, the 1965 National Singles Championships started again. I was in top form entering the competition, and was quite confident that I could win the Championship. The competition was held in November in NingXia's YinChuan. Players all over China gathered there for this prestigious event, which was quite a spectacle at that time.  ||In the first few rounds, Hu and me were leading the pack. I had used the 57 Cannons successfully to defeat GuangDong's Yang GuanLin and Cai FuRu, and the outlook was good. ||In the sixth round, Yang and Hu had fougt ferociously, and after over 100 rounds, their game ended in a win for Yang. Yang had showed his endgames prowess and used 1r1p2e to defeat Hu's 1r1p1a1e. Their game was so exciting that halfway through, all eyes were on that game. ||After his loss, Hu's next opponent was me. At this point in time, we had the same scores going, so, whoever was the winner of this match would most likely be crowned champion.||In this match, I had managed to turn the tables on Hu right from the beginning, and I was quite confident of myself when the match reached the endgame stage.  Hu was also in time trouble.||At this stage in the game, I made a move and went to relieve myself. Hu made his move quickly and did likewise.||When he came back from the toilet, he made his way straight toward the International Chess section of the arena. I called out to him : " Young Hu, do not be too nervous, aren't you heading in the wrong direction? "||It was then that Hu turned around and made his way back to our table. ||Upon sitting down, Hu offered me a cannon (move 60). After he made his move, he gasped loudly. I did not think much and took his offer, and hell broke loose. With this move, I lost the game...||It looked like Hu's moves outside of the board were also very lethal indeed!"  || [/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Using the central cannon as a black counter against the elephant opening is often thought to be at a disadvantage for black. This stems from the line of thought that the screen horse defense could hold its own as a black counter, and when the sides are switched, red would not only be able to play the screen horse defense, he would also have the move advantage. That is why most consider the central cannon to be a less than ideal counter against the elephant. ||But this is but one side of the coin. ||Being able to move first would obviously help you out in maintaining control of the game, but it does not mean that you would have it. Being able to be in control would have to depend on the moves that follow.||Therefore, if the central cannon counter is able to accurately analyse the pros and cons of red's first E3+5 move and decrease the efficiency of this move as much as possible, playing the central cannon as a counter to the elephant opening would still be very viable. And, it would still be able to fight for control of the game too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]I should have played R9+1 instead. ||Jim: Pls click on the variation to understand GM Hu's thoughts.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]I should have played R2=8 instead of this move. That way, I could play A6+5 to threaten to capture red's chariot and then play R8=6 for the exchange offer.||That way, I would have a desirable formation and would still hold on to the lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]It would be inadvisable for black to play C3+7 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Correct move. Using the chariot to patrol the riverbank would allow me many options for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]If I played R8=7, black might counter with C3=2 to  exchange and simplify the game to his favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]C7=8 followed by C8+1 is another option, allowing black to pin some of red's material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]P5+1 would be a more efficient move now, allowing black more options, while at the same time giving black's chariot to move on his pawn rank.||It would perhaps be the most efficient move that black can come up with.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]Playing H8-6 now would be to red's benefit.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]Mistake on my part!||I should have played H6+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]K4=5 is not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment76]R6-1 is not advisable now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment116]C6=4 would seem to be a better move as black would seem to have more options.[/DhtmlXQ_comment116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment118]K5-1 would lead to a very drawish game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment118]
[DhtmlXQ_comment119]I took advantage of the fact that Black was also in time trouble, and decided to cause some chaos with this move, thereby increasing his difficulty to win.  ||Jim: This was the move that was mentioned in GM Wang's diary, aka the toilet move...lol. ||||The chinese transcript from GM Wang's diary are provided for those who understand Chinese. ||???,?????????????,?????????,????,?????,??????????,?????????????????(??,?????????,???????6?4??????????????:?6?4,????,?4?5,?????,?????8?5????????????????????7?8???????,????,?????????????:?6?4,????,?4?5,????,?5?1,????,?4?5,?????????)?????,????????????,???????????8?6,????,?4?5,????,?6?2,??,???????,??????,???????????????ï¿½[/DhtmlXQ_comment119]
[DhtmlXQ_comment120]Mistake! C6+4 would be much better and black would still be on the winning end of things!||Jim: Below are more exerpts from GM Wang's diary.||||Wang: "As can be seen from the diagram, if I had played C6+4 to block the red cannon, the game would be still to my advantage. ||Once I captured the cannon, Hu immediately played R1=4 to capture my advisor, and after a few more rounds (see moves) , I was forced to return material to him. After that, things went from bad to worse and I finally lost the game, which I had already lost half at this stage."||||Jim: ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment120]
[DhtmlXQ_comment129]And after gaining back lost material, the game is basically decided in red's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment129]
[DhtmlXQ_comment153]And black as only one elephant left to defend. Red  would win for sure now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment153]
[DhtmlXQ_comment179]And black resigned.||Jim: Whew...[/DhtmlXQ_comment179]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_123]GM Wang: If Hu did not take the horse, I could play H7+8 and once my horse was able to join in the attack, Hu would also be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_123]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_130]GM Wang: "And I would have captured material with the discovered check."[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_130]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_126]GM Wang: And it would still be to black's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_126]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_125]And the game would become very drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_125]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_79]And red would be in a very fine position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_76]And black could now move his cannon to my left flank whereby there would be many options for attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_71]And red would still hold on to the lead firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_63]And red would be much more aggressive.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_24]Jim: why this is not feasible now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]And black would lose the chariot and the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]Jim: These were the moves that were suggested in move 9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_27]And red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_27]
