[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120220 Wudangshan Cup ||Zhao Xinxin W Zheng Yihong||C36 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Left Riverbank Horse variation.||ECCO:C36 ?????????????????||The 2010 Wudangshan Cup was a national event held in April 2010. There was a group tournament and an  individual's section. ||18 teams from 14 provinces took part in the team event and after 9rounds of competition in 4 days, the star studded team consisting Hong Zhi, Jiang Chuan, Wang Yang and Zhang Qiang were champions.||In the individual's section, GM Liu Dahua came in first with an undefeated record of 5W4D0L. ||2nd --> Jiang Chuan, 3rd,--> Zhang Qiang, 4th--> Zhao Xinxin , 5th --> Meng Chen, 6th --> Huang Zhufeng||In this game, GM Zhao does badly in the opening and only manages to overturn the tables in the midgame after GM Zheng falls into time trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Zhao Xinxin, one of the top ranked Xq players (consistently in top 10) in China today.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]GM Zheng goes for this very violent variation!||Always full of fireworks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]GM Zhao chooses to play it safe with this move. One of the most fireworked filled variations is to play P5+1.||Perhaps GM Zhao fears that GM Zheng has something in the back of his pocket...and chooses this variation instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]H7+5 is another viable option, allowing black to retain his 7th file pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]GM Zhao chooses to keep things complicated with this move so that he still has his chances.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]This is a more proactive move from black. It allows the cannon to move to the left flank for a concentrated attack on red's right side or from the center with C2=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Another possibility is to play R9=8.||In retrospect, R9=8 would seem better for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Good move! Black pins red's cannon rank with this move. Black prepares to play C8=5 and then capture the horse with the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Red is forced to sacrifice the elephant to try to keep his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Post game analysis suggests E3-1 as a better move as not much is done with this attempted capture of the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Black insists on controlling this rank with this brilliant move![/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Very versatile and lively play from black!||Black suddenly shifts his focus to red's left flank, preparing to play C2=1 on the next move.||Red is under much pressure![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Post game analysis showed that this was not as good as C6=8!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]At this stage, although black is better off, time trouble starts to appear. Post-game commentary noted that GM Zheng started to rush his moves. ||Although better off, GM Zhao's chariot was just superb in defense, disallowing black any immediate chance of attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]And after the exchange, the pressure on red's right side is relieved...time to turn the tables![/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]GM Zheng is in time trouble now and makes this move, costing him the game...||R2-4 to pin the red horse and chariot would be much better, slowing the pace of red's attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment81]And red captures the black horse with this move!||Red has a deadly kill with H5+7!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment81]
[DhtmlXQ_comment87]And black loses. ||The moves end here! ||Red has forked black's cannon and chariot and has the superior pawn advantage, while black is in time trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]Say black tries this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_65]and it would be a relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]and black would be on cruise control...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]and red would still have the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]and red would still have the initiative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]And red would be slightly better off in terms of the development of the pieces but black can live with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]And black can be satisfied with this outcome.||The game has been simplified much.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_16]This is also a possible variation for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]and this is another viable alternative from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]One of the commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]and it would be a very very exciting game right at the start![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]
