[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120319 2004 A League Liu Dianzhong L Zhao Guorong||ECCO C66 57 Cannons vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement||ECCO:C66 ????????7?||Another GM vs GM game in this team tournament.||The commentaries were given by Master Zhang Xiaoping[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And at this stage, the opening is the 57 Cannons without pawn advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Right Pawn Ranked Cannon Variation.||C8+4 or C2+2 are other commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This is a less volatile way of play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red tries to look for ways to win.||For more cautious players, R2+2 or R2=4 would allow better control of the game, although the game would still be drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]This is an interesting move from GM Liu.||Under most circumstances, R8+4 is played ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Good move from GM Zhao!||With this move, black does not fear red discovered attack with R8=7. It also allows black to pin the red chariot and cannon in this file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Another good move from GM Zhao!!!||GM Zhao prepares to play C7=3 to attack the horse. ||At this stage in the game, as Master Zhang Xiaoping observed, red has the material advantage but they are ill positioned and not very effective. The loss of an elephant further worsened red's plight.||Black has successfully seized the initiative of the game from red and is slowly increasing his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]With this advisor move, black adopts a wait and see approach. Good move!||Red's chess pieces are being pinned by black now and does not have much room to maneuver. Any move that red makes now would actually disrupt his defenses further. ||Click on the variation below to see what would happen if black rushed his moves and played C3=7 instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]The black pawn that has crossed the river more than makes up for the material disadvantage that black has.||This pawn is now a huge threat to red.||Black has the game under his control now![/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And black starts his attack!||For beginners, Black cannot play E5+3 to take the red horse or it would be a checkmate win for red with C8+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]And GM Liu goes at it! Never one to bow down, GM Liu decides counter with aggressiveness.||A nuclear war is about to happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]Red's attack down black's right flank may seem very threatening but black has a very stable defensive formation. With this one chariot, black is able to hold off red's aggressions, leaving black no target to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]R8+6 is not advisable now. GM Liu shows off his defensive capabilities with this move.||Please click on the variation below to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment64]GOOD MOVE!||Black prepares his horse for attack with this move. Very target oriented![/DhtmlXQ_comment64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]Super sacrifice!!!!||Black is on the road to victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]Red does not dare to take the cannon offer![/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]And GM Liu resigns!||There is no way that red can resolve black's C3=8!||And with this win, GM Zhao gives the Heilongjiang Team the crucial point in their matchup! ||The following moves were added by me to show why.||If there are mistakes please tell me.[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]mate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_76]mate[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_75]Same thing would happen if A5-6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_78]mate[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_69]If red accepted the exchange...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_72]Preparing for the tiger silhouette...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_75]The king is forced to the rooftop of the palace, into the firing range of the menacing black pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_80]And black wins with P6=5 on the next move![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_57]Weak move![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_58]Correct move![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_60]And red's chess pieces are all very congested with little room to maneuver.||Black can slowly organize his attack now with this pawn, cannon and horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_61]And black would be in all sorts of trouble with this counter sacrifice from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]Too rushed!||This actually allows red to adjust his defensive formation accordingly![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]And after red's left flank is free from the pin, red's material advantage would give him the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]Commonly played move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]And both sides would have targeted areas for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]For players who prefer aggressiveness, this variation may be chosen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]And the moves that follow would be complex and very volatile. The speed of the pieces would be a very important factor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]
