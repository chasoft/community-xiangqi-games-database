[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120223 jjls Huang Zhufeng W Li Xuesong||c32 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen horse Defense with Right Central Elephant||ECCO:C32 ???????????????||||Red is Master Huang Zhufeng ???, an up and coming player hailing from Zhejiang Province. He is also one of the youngest Xiangqi Masters in China today, being born in 1992. Master Huang was awarded his title of Xiangqi master by coming in in the top 18 placings in the 2007 Chinese National Singles Championships. Master Huang is one of the hottest prospects in China today.||||||Black is Matster Li Xuesong???, hailing from Hubei Province.  Master Li was born in 1977 and was awarded the title of Xiangqi Master when he took part in the 1994 Chinese National Xiangqi Championships. He was performed consistently and even managed 3rd place in a competition whereby only Xiangqi Masters or Champions were eligible to take part held in 1999. Master Li is now one of the hosts in a Hubei Province program <<????>>[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black tries not to play the more fashionable openings.||Black could play C8=9 for the edge cannon for chariot exchange variation, H7+6 for the lt riverbank horse variation or simple A4+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]This is one of the relatively newer ways of playing this opening![/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]This is an improvised move and this is the flying dagger in this game!||It catches black completel off guard.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]At this stage in the game, red has complete control of the game. ALL of red's major pieces are very lively with much room to maneuver and multiple points to attack.||Black on the other hand is hanging on for dear life and all of his chess pieces are congested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Within the blink of an eye, red removes the pesky black pawn and now has effectively conentrated all his forces for attack on black's right flank.||The game is red's for the taking now![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]Black is forced to make this move. E5+7 is not an option now![/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Red attacks mercilessly with this move, preparing for C7+7 or C7+6..there are just so many options for red to choose from now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]And black resigns![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_43]and red would gain material. This would accelerate the winning process.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]This was one of the variations played...in the past.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]and it would be a relatively even game![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]and black can be satisfied with this outcome!||This is one of the more recent variations of this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]another commonly played variation....[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]and although red has sacrificed a horse, he has a deadly attack on black's right flank![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
