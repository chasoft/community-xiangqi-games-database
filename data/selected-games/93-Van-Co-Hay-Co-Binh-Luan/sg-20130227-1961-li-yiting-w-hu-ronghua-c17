[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130227 1961 Li YiTing W Hu RongHua C17||||ECCO:C17 ?????????||ECCO:C17 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot vs Screen Horse Defense.?????????||||Jim: Another file from the net. GM Li YiTing is one of the less known GM, but he was the second ever National Champion, after dethroning the much feard Yang GuanLin. GM Hu was the third National Champion ever. GM Li has also been instrumental in helping and promoting Xiangqi and chess in HuBei province. GM Liu DaHua et cetera are all benefactors of his work. GM Li has long since retired after the Cultural Revolution.||The commentator was unknown. ||||In late July 1961, along the shores of the beautiful SongHua Lake in HarBin City, a friendly competitiion whereby participants from HuBei, JiangSu, LiaoNing, JiLin, HeiLongKiang and HarBin took part. Li YiTing was the final victor and in the last round of the competition, Li's battle with Hu was one of the best matches in the entire tournament. Both had started the game with relatively new opening variations, and fought tooth for tooth in the midgame. It was perhaps the best game in this friendly involving the 6 provinces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Jim: Charging the central pawn was quite popular back then. It has been extensively studied and introduced in the Plum Flower Springs Manual.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]In te first few rounds of the match, red had started off with the central cannon with central pawn advancement variation, while black had countered with the double headed snake pawn variation of the screen horse defense.||At this point, red played the left ranked chariot, preparing to aid his attack right down the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]In the past, C8+2 was played to allow black to move H3+4 to counter red's aggressions.||Playing H2+1 instead was a new attempt to develop black's left horse. It was quite a new variation at that time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Black had played H7+6 in the 10th round and continued with a pawn sacrifice. It was quite aggressive play from black.||At this point in time, if red did not accept the pawn, and played R2+1 instead, black would also have many options of attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Advancing the cannon to attack the central horse was part of the plan that black had in store. It was a continuation of Black's H7+6 in move 10.||Black would have achieved his goal of launching a counterattack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]At this point in time, black has started attacking.||For red, other then playing R3=4 would be the best counter he could come up with as he would have a hard time trying to handle black's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]?[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And both players have attacked in full force over the past few rounds.||Playing this move would force deny red a chance to  play R4+1 and exchange chariots, while at the same time threaten to attack red's cannon.||But it would seem that C7=4 would be a viable alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Black could have captured the red cannon with K5+1. Black would threaten with C7-1 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And black could have threatened to attack with R2=3 and red would have a hard time dealing with black's aggressions.||A mistake that would prove lethal to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Delicate play from red!||Instead of capturing the elephant, red protects himself first with this move.||Jim: Please compare playing the king K5=4 now with  the same move in the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]From move 26 onward, both players went to and fro, attacking viciously.||At this point in time, black must sacrifice his horse for red's pawn to save himself.||In the end, black would have lost all his elephants and advisors and red would attack with the pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]And red won the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]And red could not play this move now to save himself, as...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_52]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_56]And black would gain material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_58]And black would have the obvious advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]And black would not be far from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_58]And black should win with the pawn advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_52]And black would be faster to kill with the angler horse checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_52]And black would have the material and positional advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_52]
