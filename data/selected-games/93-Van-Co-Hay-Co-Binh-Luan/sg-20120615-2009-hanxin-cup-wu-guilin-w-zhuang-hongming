[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120615 2009 hanxin cup wu guilin w zhuang hongming D03||This game was played relatively recently in the first ever Hanxin Cup in 2009, one of the premiere Xq competitions in the world today.||Commentary was provided by GM Jiang Chuan and given in quotation marks.||Although the ECCO is D03, it is basically a ranked chariot vs filed chariot type of opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]"Playing the ranked chariot first is a strategic consideration from red, ensuring that he would be able to play the ranked chariot. H2+3 is the commonly played move.||Black can thwart red's plans with R9+1 also.||IGM Wu Guilin is an expert in this opening and has won many competitions with it. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]" This riverbank chariot is able to support the entire black defense. R8+6 is outdated ..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]"And black plays the proper horses to negate the effects of red's proper horses"[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]"When compared to playing C2+2 for the same move, black would be disadvantaged with this move as red would attack first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]"This is not a very efficient move as it allows red to take the advantage very easily.A4+5 would be better. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]"Not a very efficient move! H7-9 would allow black to be more versatile in the game to come."[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]"Straightforward and direct attack on the center!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]"C2+4 would have been more practical!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]"And red chooses to move his chariot out of harm's way! Very defensive oriented move!"||Jim: Maybe if red played E7+5 instead, black could answer with C6+5![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]"And during the past few moves whereby black was working hard to get his horse into battle, red has also made many improvisions to his formation."[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]"This does not seem to as good a move as P5+1! Red could also prepare to play C3=8..."||Pls click on the variation below to see GM Jiang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]"This move does not do much. H9+7 would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]"And red slowly increases his lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]"Good move! Red makes use of this move to cause unrest in black's defence!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]"Black tries to salvage his predicament with an exchange offer![/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"!!! Great move. Red does not fall for black's trap with R8+1."[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]"Another nice move from red! Red does not let down his guard with P6+1. If he had played P6+1, the development of his left horse would be hindered!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]"There is a better move for black albeit hardly noticeable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]"Red attacks effortlessly and black does not have a clue as to how to defend!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]"Up till this stage, black has yet to resolve the pin on his chariot and cannon, while red has already prepared his troops for the final attack."[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]"And black resigns..."||The following moves were the explanation given by GM Jiang Chuan.||"Red is threatening to attack with P5+1 and H-+5. To salvage his predicament, black would have to play R6-3..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]"And after losing material, red would not be too far from a checkmate!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_70]"And red would be unable to capture the all important side pawn! DRAW!!!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]"And black would get a breather!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]"And this would be better than what happened in the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_50]"And black would still be threatening with the baseline cannon!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_41]GM Jiang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_42]Say black decides to eliminate the menacing central pawn...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]And Red would be prepared to gain material by threatening to catch the horse and the cannon with this move!||Nice!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]"And it would be a standoff, black would not be so bad off."[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]"And there would be still a fight going on. Black would not be too bad."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]"This would not be too efficient either..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]"And red would spoil the balance of black's formation with this move!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_35]"And red would be better off!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_29]"And this would be to red's advantage!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_17]"Too fast!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_22]"And red would not gain much!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_12]"Correct move, allowing black to attack and defend at the same time..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_16]"A must make move for black to be able to succeed in his opening!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_26]"And it would be an even game..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_24]"Noooooo!!! Tooo fast!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_25]"And red would be much better off!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_19]"And red would be better off as red formation is basically intact and black's right horse is under attack."[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_16]"And black would be able to mount a retaliation..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_9]"Not advisable nowadays"[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_16]" And red's solitary chariot deep in black's territory is easily attacked. Black has wrestled the lead away from red..."||Jim: With this move, black also threatens to skewer with C6+3 or to capture the red chariot with C6-3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_11]"And red would have much better development of the chesspieces."[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_11]
