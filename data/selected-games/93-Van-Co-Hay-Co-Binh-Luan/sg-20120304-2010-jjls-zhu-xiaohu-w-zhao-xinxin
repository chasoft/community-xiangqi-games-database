[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120304 ||2010 A league Zhu Xiaohu W Zhao Xinxin||E38 Angel's pawn with Left Central Cannon variation vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation||ECCO:E38 ???????????????||Master Zhu Xiaohu is another up and coming star in Xiangi. Born in 1985 his first claim to fame was in 2000, when he became the Chinese National Under 14 Champion. He was also a key player whne the Jiangsu team came in 6th place in 2008.||GM Zhao Xinxin needs no further introduction.||I have chosen this board because the opening is very interesting. Had GM Zhao drawn or won, his final placings might be very different![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]So far so good...all textbook moves...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Out of the blue, Master Zhu plays this move! It is not in accordance to opening theory, but Master Zhu seems to be very well versed in this opening.||For beginners, taking the central pawn is not advisable as black can easily chase it away. After taking the central pawn, red would often need another 1-2 moves to protect this cannon, thereby using up 3 moves early into the game, and delaying the development of the other pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]This is a more stable approach to the game. Click on the variation below to see other variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]this is a commonly played variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And this is a relatively new opening for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]This was the actual move played by GM Zhao. ||C3+1 was played in another game. ||GM Zhao chose to be aggressive in hope of earning more points to improve his rankings.||C3+1 would still to be to red's advantage, so GM Zhao took a ||risk with this move.  ||Post-game analysis suggests that GM Zhao should not have played this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Good play from red!||By chasing away the black horse, red allows his own horses greater space for maneuvering. Once the horses are able to join in the battle, red would have better control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]At this stage, although both red and black are similar in material (black has two pawns that has not crossed the river), all of the red chess pieces are very mobile and can attack from many directions.||Black's pieces on the other hand are very congested, and it would take more time and effort just to develop them. The extra two black pawns remained undeveloped and are non-functional at this stage.||But red still has some way to go before winning![/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]good move1||Red restricts the moved ment of the black horse and allows his left cannon to traverse to the right side for a concentrated attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]!!Good move.||This cannon move does many things.||1) attempt to gain a cannon and a horse in exchange for it||2) pinning the king should it come out to try to escape red's H3+4 followed by H4+3 for the elbow horse check.||3) prevents the black horse from moving H6+4 to attempt a counter of his own.the black horse cannot to anywhere important now after this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]Black is forced to give up material. If he did not play this move, red would play H3+4 and black would be in deep trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]And within a short span of a few moves, red gains material and forces black to defend like crazy.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]GM Zhao does not give up so easily though!||Red must not be allowed to bring the horse across the river.||The black pawns are still too far to have any effect on the game, so black focuses on defense first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment81]Red tries to further simplify the endgame to his advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment81]
[DhtmlXQ_comment82]Black is forced to accept the exchange, and with that, red eliminates any immediate danger of a counter from black by capturing the black horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment83]And the endgame has simplified to 1r1h1c2a2e vs 1r1c2p2a2e.||For red, it would be obvious that he has the upperhand. His main goal is to try to bring all his major pieces across the river for an attack. ||Black on the other hand must try to prevent this, and amongst the three pieces, the horse is the natural target for black. If the red horse were allowed to  cross the river, it would be over.||The following moves center around this line of thought.[/DhtmlXQ_comment83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]And black puts up a strong defence. ||Red has trouble finding a weak point to attack for the moment.[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment95]And red attacks from the center![/DhtmlXQ_comment95]
[DhtmlXQ_comment114]Black tries too buy some time with  the previous moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment114]
[DhtmlXQ_comment115]Red's horse can only retreat or be caught by the black horse. Great defense![/DhtmlXQ_comment115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment120]Black tries to go for a draw now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment120]
[DhtmlXQ_comment126]And black continues his brilliant defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment126]
[DhtmlXQ_comment129]Red tries another approach...attacking from the sidelines.[/DhtmlXQ_comment129]
[DhtmlXQ_comment136]And GM Zhao's defense has been brilliant thus far. The young Master Zhu is faced with a tough challenge.||This sort of endgame is very challenging for red. ||Black's defense has been brilliant thus far but time is running out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment136]
[DhtmlXQ_comment146]Post game analysis suggests that black play R4=5 to control the red horse. It would be more proactive than this move.||Time is not to black's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment146]
[DhtmlXQ_comment152]Post game analysis suggests that black move C5=4 to defend and red would still have a hard time breaking through.||This is a costly mistake.||Red finally sees a chance.||Red starts his final campaign.[/DhtmlXQ_comment152]
[DhtmlXQ_comment160]And now the red horse is able to join in the attack. The main function of black's cannon at the baseline is to help defend the bottom rank and throat rank. Now, that function is lost and red goes on a rampage.||The price to pay for black's C5=7 on move 76 is now evident. ||Black can hold on not much longer.[/DhtmlXQ_comment160]
[DhtmlXQ_comment167]And red is almost assured of victory now. ||Red has successfully pinned the black chariot to the 4th file and the black cannon is functionless. ||Red can take his time to bully the black cannon and other defensive pieces with his chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment167]
[DhtmlXQ_comment173]The last straw. ||Red attempts to capture the most important defensive piece now, the central advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment173]
[DhtmlXQ_comment175]Black resigns after this move.||The cannon is lost and so will the rest of black's defence.||Postgame analysis noted that GM Zhao was too keen on winning and because he tried to keep things complicated, the risks he took caused him to be attacked by red's combination of 1r1h1c. And although his defense in endgame was tight, time pressure caused him to make mistakes and gradually caused him the game. Kudos to the young master Zhu Xiaohu.[/DhtmlXQ_comment175]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_175]and red would be assured of victory after capturing the black chariot with this discovered check.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_175]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_175]and red would be prepared to play H4+6 to capture the advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_175]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_82]This may seem like a good move but in actual fact, it puts black in further trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_85]and red would gain more material. ||Black cannot capture the red cannon with E5-3 or red would checkimate with C2+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]And this game ended in a draw. I have no information on who played this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_53]And after the exchange of pieces, red is much better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]this is another variation commonly played, similar to the moves played in this game, with a slight change in the order of moves that is.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]This variation was played in the past but black seemed to have better results.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]And all of black's pieces are well developed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]This was another variation given in my book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_43]And red is slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]these were the moves in another game played by GM Zhao Guorong (of no relation to GM Zhao Xinxin).[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]And black has gained the lead from red. GM Zhao evetually won this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_25]And red would be slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_25]
