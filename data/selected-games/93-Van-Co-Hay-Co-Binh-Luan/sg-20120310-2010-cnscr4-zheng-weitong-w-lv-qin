[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120310 2010 cnscr4 ||Zheng Weitong W Lv Qin||Round 4 of the 2010 Chinese National Singles Xiangqi Championships and one of the hottest rising stars faces one of the best in the history of the sport: Sichuan Province's Master Zheng Weitong takes red to go against GM Lv Qin.||Prior to the National Singles Competition, Master Zheng Weitong just won the 2010 Yang Guanlin Cup, another prestigious event and was in superb form.||This game was commented by Master Huang Hailin and GM Zhao Xinxin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]The Angel's Pawn or Angel's Guide according to the WXF, is a favorite opening of Zheng. And faced with one of the best in the history of the sport, Master Zheng gives his best...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]According to my book, GM Lv Qin was NOT well known for playing this variation. E3+5 was played more often. Perhaps this was his strategy of travelling the less beaten path to prevent any traps that Master Zheng would have prepared.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]P7+1 was a favourite move of another Guangdong GM, Zhuang Yuting. GM Lv is the coach of the Guangdong team and maybe after some preparation and analysis, he decided to use this move in this battle.||R1+1, P1+1 are other commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And black openings up his defense with the Single Horse Defense.||C8+4 would be a more proactive approach to the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Post-game analysis suggested that black should have played A6+5, allowing more versatility and options to counter in his game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And Master Zheng played this move...||it was an improvement over C8+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Post-game analysis suggested this to be an inappropriate move for black.||Red has made his intentions clear: to maneuver the horse to the center for attack.||By playing this move, black actually gives up the center to red, and it could easily cost him the opening.||P3+1 might have been better ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Post-game analysis suggested this to be another less than satisfactory move.||R4+4 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]GM Lv was forced to make this move.||Post-game analysis suggested that GM Lv might have miscalculated and thought that he had a counter with C3=2...[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Great move! A sacrifice before gaining back the lost piece.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]And after the exchange, red not only has simplified the game to his advantage, he had also gained two extra pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]Nice move!||This is beautiful trap from red to gain material![/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]GM Lv sees through red's intentions and plays this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]To prevent red from having a smothered cannon checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]xqLover: Why Black not play E5+3 ??!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment71]P7=6 might have been a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment81]Red chose a slower pace of attack.||Master Huang and GM Zhao suggested P6=7 as a much faster attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment81]
[DhtmlXQ_comment86]Prior to a few moves earlier, GM Lv seemed to be slightly better off. However, he should have played C2=5 to attempt to mate before this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]And GM Lv makes a big blunder with this move!!!||He loses his horse and the game just like that![/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment95]And after the check, red would play H6+5.||GM Lv resigned.||Although Master Zheng had a bit of luck in this game, his opening preparation paid off.||Master Zheng went on to finish 7th place in the tournament.[/DhtmlXQ_comment95]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_94]This was perhaps the only move that black could make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_99]And red would still have the upperhand. Black would still have a hard time![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_86]threatening to checkmate...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_92]And black would still be able to hold on![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_83]and in comparison to the actual moves played, red's pace of attack is much quicker and fierce.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_82]not so good as C2+1[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_85]and red would be so much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_71]This was the suggested move. It would be more direct![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_72]Black would be forced to make this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_73]And red would be better off both material and positional wise![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_67]And the black cannon is trapped![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]In my manual, whereby Master Huang Hailin and GM Zhao Xinxin offered the analysis, it was suggested that perhaps GM Lv had thought that he would be faster with an attack down red's left flank.||However....[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_37]GM Lv must have seen this move, that is why he was forced to play R7-5 for move 15.||Red threatens to win with the iron bolt checkmate...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]Sacrifice kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_43]And mate!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_28]And black would be able to use the two chariots to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]And black would have a cross river pawn that would threaten red's left side.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_20]This move would not be ok now!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]ouch...Red forks two chariots with this move.||If red had played C8=5 on move 10, this play would not have been possible.||Kudos to Master Zheng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_19]These were the moves played in another game in the same tournament one year earlier in 2009. Red was Master Huang Zhufeng and Black was GM Xu Yinchuan. Master Huang had played this move first...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_27]And the game got messy.||Master Zheng must have analysed this game and made improvisions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_27]
