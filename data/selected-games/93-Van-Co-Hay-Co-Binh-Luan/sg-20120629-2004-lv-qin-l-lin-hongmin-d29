[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120629 2004 Lv Qin L  Lin Hongmin D29||ECCO D29 Same Direction Cannons: Filed Chariot vs Ranked chariot||ECCO:D29 ??????? or simply ???????????||||Another sdc game found on the internet. This was played back in 2004 in a team competition. Commentary is believed to have been given by Master Yan Mujiang, whose books I have always enjoyed.||||"In 2004,a Xiangqi competitions was organinzed by TangGou Brewery  ????????. The Shanghai team were the eventual team champions, whereby each member received 10000 yuen. In this competition Shanghai's GM Lin Hongmin performed very well and helped his team with a 2W1D no loss record, and was tops in the points amassed."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Please click on the variation below to see what would happen if black chose the R4+5 variation instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]"Playing the side cannon to pin the red elephant is an often used tactic in this opening. R4+5 is another possible option."||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]" As seen in this game, red sacrifices his elephant to try to gain more initiative in the game. Correct move! Black might wrestle the lead away should red play C8=9, which happened to be the move played over 20 years ago in the National Individual's championships held in Guangzhou. Hebei's master Huang Yong took red against Shanghai's master Xu Tianli in that game!" ||Pls click on the variation to see that game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]"And this was a small improvision by black."||Please click on the variation below to understand why this is a better move than playing R-=6 instead!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]"Perhaps playing P5+1 would have even been better!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]"This is a more effective pin from red as compared to R2=3 ." ||Click on the variation for R2=3[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]"As seen from the board, perhaps it was the player's initial feel of the game to have let him made this move. Under most circumstances, our initial sense of the game is correct but there are exceptions. There is a better move for red to increase his advantage of the game with H4+5!"||Jim: Brilliant analysis by Master Yan. Please click on the moves below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]"Red cannot play H4+5 now or black could counter with R2=3 to catch the cannon!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]"And black protects the critical central pawn with this horse move. After the match, GM Lin said that heaved a huge sigh of relief after being able to make this move!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]"Red was led into thinking that the black cannon would be cornered and thus captured. R2=5 would be a better move!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"C7=6 is not advisable as it would lead to a draw!" ||Pls click on the variation below[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]"At this point in time, black was about to run out of time (according to the rules, black would hae to make 30 moves in an hour). That is why red decided to be slow the tempo of the game down. Unfortunately for red, black's sudden cannon sacrifice turned the entire game around!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]"Black does not let his guard down to play R2=6. It would be a winning situation for red if he had done so!"||Click on the variation to understand Master Yan's commentary.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]"Black cannot play R1=7 or red could force an exchange with R7-2"[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment98]"And black won the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment98]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_63]"And red would have forced and exchange.After the exchange red would be on the winning side!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_60]Uh-huh...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_63]"And black would be all sorts of trouble. Red would be not far away from a win!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]"If red tried to capture the cannon..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_54]![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_58]"Black sacrifices his cannon first before gaining back the lost piece. This would be a drawish game. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_51]Master Yan's suggestion[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_55]"And red would be prepared to play H4+2 first followed by H2-3 to attack and defend at the same time!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_48]And red would be all sorts of trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_45]Master Yan's suggested move![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_46]"Black cannot play E7+5..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_48]"And red would play R6+3 or R6+5 to gain material and thus win!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_47]"and red would threaten to checkmate with R6+9. Black would have to move the advisor and red could follow up with C7=5!!! for a checkmate threat!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]"And black could take his time to strengthen his defences or readjust his formation with E7+5 or E3+5.."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]"And the position of the black chariot on the sidelines is less than satisfactory. That is why black challenged red for an exchange back in move 12."[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]Actual moves played in the game whereby Master Huang Yong played red against Master Xu Tianli.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_32]"And black would have wresteled the lead away from red!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]Another possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_28]"And black uses one chariot to exchange for one horse and one cannon, which are roughly equivalent . Black would still be able to hold his own as the game progresses. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_14]Another often played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_20]And the game turns into an allout fist fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_20]
