[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130112 2007cnsc Dang Fei D Wang Bin D21||||ECCO:D21 ???????||ECCO:D21 Same Direction Cannons: Filed Chariot vs Ranked Chariot. ||Another interesting file found on the internet.||Commentary was given by GM Wang Bin, who played black in the game. His opponent, Master Dang Fei was just starting to stamp his name in XiangQi.||||'Dang Fei is one of the competitors on the HuBei Youth team, and is a disciple of "The Oriental Computer", GM Liu DaHua. When there is such a strong master, there can be no weak students. Dang Fei may not be wel-known, but I dared not be complacent. ||The following represents the game that we played."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Playing the ranked chariot was to try to limit the choices that red could have, forcing him to play the filed chariot vs ranked chariot variation. I was more familiar with the variations in this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Red could also consider playing R1+1 or C5+4.||Jim: Pls click on the variations to see what the GM had in mind.||Incidentally, the moves given in the variation 3c were the actual moves played when GM Liu DaHua himself went up against GM Wang Bin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]P7+1 is another commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Playing the side horse was my preferred approach to this opening. ||When compared to H2+3, this variation was more stable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]This is one of red's options.||Another commonly played opening would be to play H3+4 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]In the past, C5=4 was the fashionable move to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]NEW MOVE!||This was never seen in previous competition.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And Dang drew first blood this move.||H2+3 would have lead to a less volatile game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]This sacrifice is a continuation of red's H2+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And I decided not to accept the sacrifice and risk facing red head on.||I was in time trouble and decided not to opt for such a complex variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Correct move. I did not want to give red a chance to change and adjust his formation.||From this move onward, the game had become intertiwned.||We both had immediate concerns to address.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]This was to prepared for red to play R2+9 on the next move followed by C8=4.||It would not be good for red to play C8=4 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And it becomes a head on battle from this point onward.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]I decided to fight fire with fire, ignoring red's C4+6 attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And red calmly played this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And I answered calmly too with this move. ||Playing R2=5 would not seem to be a good move at this point in thime.||After pondering over the variations (Jim: Given in the in the variation), black decided to play C5=6 to prevent red's C4+6 attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]After red's central pawn is eliminated, the pace of the game would slow down from a head on battle to more of a game of deploying the forces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]It is obvious that red's central pawn was much deadlier than red's pawn on the 7th file. That is why I did not even consider playing P3+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]And red changed his strategy from a attack-oriented one to one which was more defensive-oriented.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]According to the rules, every move made would allow 30 seconds to be added, which is why I offered to exchange chariots to buy some time. ||This was one of the tactics that is often employed in competition when time was running out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]And red is forced to sacrifice his pawn.||If red played P7=8, black would still capture ith with R3=2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]Playing C5+3 is another possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]And red defended very well with this move!||I had missed out on this possibility by red. Instinctively, I had felt that if red accepted the exchange, after playing C-+3, I would have the stronger attack down the center. It would seem that red would lose if the game continued if red were to accept the exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]This was to ensure that I would not lose.||I had also thought of playing H2+3 at that time...||but was unable to think much due to time constraints.||C-+3 was not feasible at this point in time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]At this point in time, black had the extra elephant and was better material wise.||However, red's pieces had better positioning, so it would require much effort for either side to win.||That was why red decided to offer a draw here.||After much consideration, and seeing that black had would also have a hard time trying for a win, and as the minute hand kept hovering over on the one minute mark, both players decided to draw the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]And red could have countered with this move.||Instinctively, I felt that I would not be able to crack open red's defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_61]And red could still defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_41]And red would have been able to stifle my attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]And red could still defend while at the same time still have the attacking option of playing P5+1 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_47]And there was nothing that I could do to prevent red from saving himself with R2=5 for the next move.||Once that move was played, it would still be a very complex game but red's central pawn would now become very lethal. And it would seem instinctively that red would have more choices for attack as the game progressed.||That is why after much consideration, I deceded not to play R3=5 for move 16.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]In the ensuing moves, black would be faster than red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_34]And black would be quicker in the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]And I could counter with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]And although red would be attacking my left flank with the cannon and chariot, they would not cause too much trouble as his left flank would not be able to provide reinforcements in time.||Black would still have his chances as the game proceeded.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_27]And the battle would become a head on confrontation very quickly.||It would be a contest of speed but each side would have immediate issues to address.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]And the game would be quickly simplified. Black could be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]And the game would become intertwined. Red would still hold the lead in the game,.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_13]Commonly played move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_26]And it be a standoff. Red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_15]Or red could also choose to play R2+5 for this move. ||Each variation would lead to different complex variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_12]And red would have played the double headed snake pawn formation while I would have had to play the double ranked chariots. This would lead to a very volatile game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_6]And I would have played the chariot to take control of this rib file first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_12]And the game was going to be simplified very quickly. As I was playing black, this was a possibility where I could accept.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_12]
