[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120522 2005 cnsc Master Pan Zhenbo W GM Xu Yinchuan D28||ECCO:D28 Same Direction Cannons: Filed Chariot vs Ranked Chariot. ||ECCO:D28 ???????||Opening name given in chinese: ??????????????? or the same direction cannons: Filed chariots with proper horses and double headed snake pawn formation vs double ranked chariot with proper horses.||Another file found on the internet. ||This game was played in the 2005 Chinese National Singles Competition in the 8th round.||Master Pan Zhenbo may not be well known to some, but he has played superbly in the past decade. He was runner up in this competition, narrowing becoming champion. But that was not his greatest feat. Master Pan was actually the champion of the singles competition in the 2007 Asian Xiangqi competition. ||GM Xu Yinchuan needs no introduction. ||Commentary was provided by Master Ge Weipu, one of the sifus of GM Sun Yongzheng. ||"This game was played in the 8th round of the 2005 Chinese National Singles Competition. After 7 rounds of intense competition, Hubei's Wang Yang led the pack with 5.5 points. Tied at 5 points apiece were Guangdong's Xu Yinchuan and Li Hongjia. Players who had accumulated 4.5 points included Jilin's GM Tao Hanming, Master Pan Zhenbo, Shenyang's GM Bu Fengbo, Jiangsu's GM Wang Bin, Beijing's Master Jiang Chuan (he had not made GM yet...). "||The importance of this game to both players can be seen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]"In the same competition, in round 1, GM Xu's opponent was Hebei's Master Yan Wenqing. They had the exact same opening.In that game, R1+1 was played instead ... "||Please click on the variation to see the game..||"In this game, GM Xu made refinements and played the chariot to the rib files first to prevent the red horse from playing H7+6 followed by H6+4 ...A point noteworthy to mention is that Shanghai's Sun Yongzheng has used this opening many times in actual competition with desirable results."||Jim: in case you did not know, Master Ge Weipu was one of the GM Sun's teachers.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]"Playing the cross river chariot to control black's riverbank is a commonly used ploy. Another often played variation would be A6+5 ..."||Please click on the variation ..||"The A6+5 variation has been extensively covered by Hebei's Fan Xiangjun, Shanxi's Huo Xianyong, Fujian's Zheng Naidong and Wang Mingteng.in the September 2005 edition of '????'."[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"By charging the horse to the riverbank, Red tries to simplify the game. C8+4 would be another possible alternative with many other options for attack. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]"If red played R7=8 now, black would have C5+1 and R6+6 as possible counters..."||Please click on the variations...[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]"R3=7 could be another choice... forcing black to counter with R6=7 or E3+5 ... " ||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]"As seen in this board, black retreats the chariot to protect the central pawn.This shows that black does not want to take chances. As this game was played life, many spectators wondered why GM Xu did not play R7+1 to capture the horse...? Let us see what would happen..."||Please click on the many variations below to understand why GM Xu did not accept the sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]"Red prepares to sacrice the horse for an all out attack! A very proactive and aggressive choice!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]"Accepting the sacrifice now shows that GM Xu is not afraid of backing down from a challenge!!! Although it is risky, it does show GM Xu's resolve. If black chose to be on the defensive, he could have played C2=4..."||Pls click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]"This second sacrifice is a continuation of Red's original battle plans! "[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]"Good move from black to defend! Playing A5-4 would lose the game real quick!" ||Pls click on the variation below to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]"At this point in time, perhaps a better move for black would be K5=6! Black would still have a chance to go for a draw! Please click on the variation below to understand the variations played!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]"Red has two other options to choose from...R5+1 and R5=3" ||Pls click on the variations below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment64]"As can be seen, black attempts to entangle red's chess pieces. Actually, in retrospect, this is not a good move. Although black is one material up, but his defences have been torn apart and is having a hard time defending. Perhaps black could have played P5+1 ..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]"From move 34-37, in just a short span of 4 moves (34-37) black has lost all his pawns! That is a tragic loss!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]"And both players exchange yet another major chess piece, to simplify the game into 1r3p2a2e vs 1r1c1p1a. Red has the obvious upperhand!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]"Red's three pawns make it across the river. Black has a hard time defending now! If black chose to play P3+1 now..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment115]"And Black resigned!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_95]"And the game would simplify into a sure-win 3p2a2e sw 1r1p1a endgame for red!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_95]

[DhtmlXQ_comment2_66]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_74]Draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_74]"And black would be alternating a check with a chase...which is not permitted according to the rules (in China). Black would have to change his moves or the game would be ruled a draw!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_74]

[DhtmlXQ_comment16_34]"If C5=8..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_37]"After the sacrifice, red would have a very strong attack going on!That is one of the reasons why GM Xu did not want to accept Red's sacrifice at move 16!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_36]"If E7+5.."[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_41]"Red is not far from a win!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_37]"And black would not be able to handle the red cannon and chariots' aggression."[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_37]
