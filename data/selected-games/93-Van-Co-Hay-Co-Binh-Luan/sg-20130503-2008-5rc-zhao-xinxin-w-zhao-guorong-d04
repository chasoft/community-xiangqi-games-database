[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130503 2008 5rc GM Zhao XinXin W GM Zhao GuoRong D04||????????||ECCO:D04 ???????||ECCO:D04 ??????? ||Jim : Have been feeling uneasy recently when I suddenly found out why...no sdc game for some time. Well, here it is... Commented by GM Jiang Chuan from his book, ????, here is a very exciting game: the battle of the Zhaos![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]GM Zhao XinXin is a master of all sorts of openings. For this reason, GM Zhao GuoRong chose the Same Direction Cannons to avoid the more commonly played Screen Horse Defense, in the hope of winning the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]This was a televised rapid chess match held in 2008 by a GuangZhou tv network.||Only the four best placed players (Xu YinChuan, Tao HanMing, Zhao XinXin and Zhao GuoRong) of the 5 Rams Cup were allowed to participate.   ||Both players started the game with the Same Direction Cannons.||Red chose the ranked chariot variation for strategic considerations. The filed chariot is usually played for red nowadays and red chose to play a "black" variation for red instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Moving the chariot across the palace, to prepare to attack the opponent's pawn rank and harass black's right hors is a commonly deployed tactic with the ranked chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]R6+5 is another feasible option.||Playing the double ranked chariots would allow red more options for attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Red deliberately chose to play the double ranked chariot variations against red's filed chariot with double headed snake pawn formation. (Jim: most agree that black playing the double rr with 37pa would be one of the best counters that the black sdc can come up with against red's fr. In this game, red deliberately chose to switch colors ...!)||Black refused to comply and chose to play this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]A must make move, to add pressure to red's right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And red does not bother with black's previous move!||Pushing the chariot so deep into enemy territory has demonstrated the younger GM's hunger and determination for a fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And both players chose to play the game according to their plan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]As can be seen, red had chosen to use his chariot to exchange for two of black's material, while at the same time obtaining a central cannon.||This would seem to have threatened black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Remember, this was a game of rapid chess. Under such time pressure, being able to calculate the complexities of the C5=3 was quite a feat.||Let us analyze what would happen if red chose to play C5=3 instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]If black chose to play C4+6 now, red would counter with C5-1![/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And black chose to maintain his threat of attacking from the sidelines.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Great move. ||This would prevent black from counter attacking with K5=6 in the future! ||(Jim: Black would then be threatening to checkmate with the double chariots if black were allowed to play K5=6).||Being able to keep their cool under such pressure was quite a feat and hats off to the two GMs![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]P5+1 would seem to be also a very enticing option.||Red would be prepared to play H6+7 for the final confrontation![/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]At this stage in the game, both players have attacked and defended very smoothly, which was worthy of their high levels of play.||Playing C++4 was perhaps more instinctive, in view of the time pressure that both players were under.||P7+1 would seem to be a viable alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Time pressure had not allowed both players much time to analyze.||This was an empty move.||C7=4 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]As red had made a wrong move with R6-1, this gave black a chance for a counter with C+-2.||Suddenly, the scales have tipped in black's favor, but again, the tide could shift in a moment's notice...[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And this was the move that cost black the game!!!||C-=3 would have been better as it would have allowed black more options.||Both players had already exceeded their time limit and that should be the main reason why black had made this mistake![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49] !!!||A bolt of lightning from out of nowhere! ||Black's king is now left stranded and had no where to go.||Red is basically assured of victory.||This tactic is often used in similar situations.||In just a few minutes time, the reaper had finally chosen his victim...[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]I would have wanted to see the expression on Black's face, but it was too late...[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]This was played to prevent H6+5![/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]And black resigned...||Although this was a relatively short game, it was a very exciting game and one to relish for a long time![/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_57]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_50]A counter sacrifice would allow red to live another day and perhaps even reap unexpected gains. ||But alas, competition is cruel, and one player is bound to make mistakes.||Both players have been playing the game at very high levels already.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]And black would be able to chase away the pesky central cannon.||It could still be anybody's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]And it would be a very complex game, where anything could happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]And this another plausible option for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]And red would show that he would be targeting black's pawn rank with this move.||Red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]And both red and black are demonstrating one of the characteristics of the Same Direction Cannons: Combinational play![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_12]In the past, this had been tried before.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]And this would lead to many complex variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
