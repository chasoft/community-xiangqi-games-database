[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121025 1984 KunHua Cup GM Hu RongHua W GM Zhao GuoRong D40||||ECCO:D40 ??????????||ECCO: D40 Central Cannon vs Left 3 Step Tiger with Opposite Direction Cannons Variation ||Jim: This game was played way back in 1984. Two sure futrure Hall of Famers met at the KunHua Cup whereby only Masters and GMs were allowed to participate. This game was recently re-published in a recent edition of Xiangqi. And because of this game, there were great changes to black's opening.||Comments were from the magazine. Master Huang Shaolong had also commented on this game in one of this books. I have combined the comments for greater indepth study into this variation. Additional footnotes have been added to help beginners grasp the principles demonstrated.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Mag: And thus far, this is a Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement red opening vs Black's Left 3 Step Tiger. This black counter gained popularity back in the 70's.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Mag: A very aggressive counter from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Huang: If red advanced the central pawn now, it would be a bloody battle. Red moves his elephant first to protect the pawn, which is a less aggressive move, allowing himself more options as the game progresses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Mag:This was the move that GM Zhao played back in 1984. It is also deemed inappropriate now, after what happened in this game!||Contemporary studies favor P7+1 instead of C2=5, allowing black more options to develop his right flank, and to counter red's attack more precisely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Huang: Red sacrifices his pawn to allow his right chariot to protect the horse. Afterward, red would retreat his cannon C8-1 as a continuation of his plans, for a concerted attack.||It would not be advisable to take the pawn now.||However, if black played R8-1...||Jim: pls click on the variation on the next move to understand...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is an often used opening tactic.||Red would often sacrifice a pawn to develop his chariot in this manner.||Jim: For beginners, this chariot move is called ???? in chinese. A reasonable translation would be High Ranked Chariot to protect the horse. With the chariot protecting red's cannon rank, the pieces on this rank could be used as cannon mounts to mount a counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Huang: As seen in the diagram, red has fufilled his plans. Black's chariot is now under attack, and so is his entire 7th file (horse and elephant).[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Huang: Black retreats his horse to prevent red from playing H3+2...||Jim: Pls click on the variation to understand why black played his move...This is one of the very basic opening tactics used in everyday play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Huang: Red advances his chariot to prevent the elephant from playing E7+9. This greatly increases  the ferocity of his attack. Red now prepares to gain the black riverbank chariot with R2=4![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Huang: C5=3 would also seem feasible...[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Mag: A meaningless move.||In retrospect, R1=2 to develop the chariot would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And Red sacrifices his horse to gain control of the rib file!||Huang: Red starts to sacrifice his horse for an attack. This is a continuation of his plans.||Jim: The moves that follow are not for the weak of heart. Very very exciting kill. Please start counting the number of times that red offers a sacrifice...||Sacrifice offer number #1[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Huang: If black accepted the sacrifice...[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Jim: Red refuses to protect his horses. Instead, he focuses on black's weak horses and unleashes a scathing attack.||Jim: Sacrifice offer #2...[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Huang: Black makes a fatal mistake in his haste. This chariot cannot leave the rib file and allow the red chariots to control both.||R1=2 would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Mag:And both chariots control the rib files. Red sacrifices his horse for the third consecutive time! Vicious!||Jim: Sacrifice offer #3...[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Mag:And red prepares to allow the king to join in the kill! A fourth consecutive sacrifice! Very tightly knit offense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Huang: If black tried R9-3...[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]!!!||Mag: Seeing that black was not interested in his remaining horse, the legendary GM decides to take things to a higher level! A chariot sacrifice is offered here! Guts![/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Mag:And red wins after black resigned.||Post-game conclusion: ||Because of this game, seldom does black play C2=5 for the 5th move any more.||In this game, red took control of the game early on and played the game with ferocity. During the midgame, red targeted black's congested palace center and with superb precision, offered five consecutive sacrifices to maneuver his chariots to the final position. Each move was like a dagger slicing through black's heart.||This is textbook material on how to attack black's centroid horse (yes, this is the official term by the WXF to describe the horse in the center of the palace).||Huang: In this opening, red defers movement of his chariot to play P7+1 first would push the game into complex variations. If black played the cross river chariot as in this game, red could choose to play the side elephant and then sacrifice his 3rd rank pawn. If black does not play R8+5 (move 4), red could play P3+1 for the double headed snake pawn formation.Red would then utilize the ranked chariots for an attack at his own pace.||Jim: For beginners, there is no way that black can resolve red's C5=6 checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]Master Huang's explanation on why this would not work![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]Huang: No way out for black!||Jim: For beginners, red would mate with the iron bolt by using his to chariots to attack the advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]Huang:Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_46]Jim: This variation was found on an internet file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_47]Jim: And red would be sure to win with R4+1 on the next move (Angler Horse checkmate!).[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]Master Huang's suggestion...||Jim: Nice![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_36]Huang: Black prepares to 'decongest' his palace center (H5-3) after this elephant is moved.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_37]Huang: And red forces his way to control the rib file. Red has further increased his lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]Mag:This would not be advisable too![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]Mag:And it would be very obvious to see who would have the upper hand in this one![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]Jim: there were no moves given but say black makes this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]Jim: Red would now be attacking both the black chariot and the black horse at the same time...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]Jim: And black would make things worse for himself  if he tried to defend in this way.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]Huang: And red would be sure to gain material now![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]Huang: And red would have so much better development of his pieces. Red would have increased the lead in his game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_8]Mag:This is another modern day variation.||At this stage, red would normally choose from the following counters:||1) C8+2||2) H7+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]Mag:And red would be slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]Mag:Not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]Mag:And black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_17]Mag:And red would have control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]Mag: And black would have formed a very tightly knit defense, that would be able to handle red's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]
