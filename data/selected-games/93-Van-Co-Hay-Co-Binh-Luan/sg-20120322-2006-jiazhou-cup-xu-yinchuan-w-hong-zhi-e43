[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120322 2006 Jiazhou Cup Xu Yinchuan W Hong Zhi ||ECCO : E43 Pawn with Right Proper Horse vs Pawn with Right Proper Horse Opening.||ECCO:E43 ???????||This was a game played in round 1 of the Jiazhou Cup in 2006. The game was a jointly organized by the Chinese Xiangqi Federation and the regioinal authorities in Shandong Province. ||GM Xu Yinchuan had been the winner of the previous 2 Jiazhou Cups and was on his quest for a third consecutive win. ||GM Hong Zhi however, had just wrestled the 5 Rams Cup away from GM Xu just 2 months earlier in Guangdong. ||The two young GMs meet in the first round![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]At this stage, the opening would be similar to that of Elephant vs 7th Pawn Advancement, although the order of the moves are not the same. ||C8=7 is another often played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Post-game analysis identifies this move as the start of black's troubles. ||Master Nie Tiewen suggests that black play R1=4 for development of this chariot. When the chariot is at the 4th file, it could move across to the other side and apply pressure to red's left flank.||In that way, Red would still have to be on his lookout.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And GM Xu sees his opportunity!||He immediately pinpoints the weakness shown by Black and targets it with this move!||This seeminly innocent move actually causes tons of trouble for red. The reason for this is because  red can now play C3+3 R9=7, followed by C8=3 !!!||In his colorful commentary, Master Nie notes that GM Hong Zhi must have really regretted his mistake the previous move![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This move would be better than R8+2![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Red tightens his grip on the game with this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]R4=6 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]This is why R6=4 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Kungfu chess from GM Xu!||Although red has control of the game, black is still hanging on and red would still have to some way to go before actually winning the game.||By playing this move, Master Nie suggests that GM Xu actually gives GM Hong the choice of attack. When faced with a myriad of choices and decisions to make, the chances of black making a mistake is greatly increased. Red does fear a loss in the control of the game, as he has it firmly under control. Crafty play from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]At this stage, it is obvious that black's horse on the 7th file is the key to the entire game. ||From the start of the game, black has been on the receiving end and is gradually under time pressure. And that is why Black makes this lethal mistake!!!||Black tries to set a small trap for red with this move...but post-game analysis suggests that it is still a very questionable move.||The following few variations were suggested by Master Nie![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Correct move. ||Red goes with the flow and avoids black's trap.[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Another brilliant move from red!||Red maintains his pin on black while at the same time, prepares to trap the black chariot with C3=4. ||The candle is now burning at both ends for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]And black is forced to sacrifice the elephant to try to save his chariot.||Unfortunately, there goes his entire defense also.||It would be just a matter of time before red wins. Master Nie commented that from this move onward, the game was just a one man show by GM Xu.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]Red plays his moves in the correct order!||Black resigned and GM Xu got his revenge.  ||The following moves explain why. ||||When the competition ended, GM Xu retains his title. 2nd to 10th placed were Zhao Guorong, Lv Qin, Hu Ronghua, Hong Zhi, Xu Tianhong, Tao Hanming, Liu Dahua, Yu Youhua and Liu Dianzhong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]and Red would gain material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_77]And black would still have a hard time handling red's aggressions![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_48]And red would be in deep trouble. Material loss is to be anticipated and a draw would be very very likely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_46]Alternative number 1[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]And red would still use his cannon and chariot to pin all of black's chariot, horse and cannon.||Black would still be unable to wriggle out of his predicament.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_46]Alternative number 2[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]better than H4-3[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_50]And the moves that follow would be similar to the moves in the actual game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_48]and black would be out of the woods temporarily.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_46]Alternative 3.||This is perhaps the best alternative from black.||Black immdiately attacks red's pawn rank and tries to eliminate the pawns as many as possible. Once the pawns are eliminated, Red would have an even harder time winning.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_45]If Red were to become greedy and go for material gain... this might be what would happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_66]And red would still have a hard time winning!||As long as black prevents the red horse or pawns  from crossing the river, it would be easy for black to force a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_24]and black would counter with this move, erasing whatever advantage that red had built![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]This would be too rushed![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_31]And red would have the significant advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_14]This is also a often played option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_20]And it would be a knotty game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_20]
