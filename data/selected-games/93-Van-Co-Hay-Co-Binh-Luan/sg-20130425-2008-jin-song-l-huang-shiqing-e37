[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130425 2008 Jin Song L Huang ShiQing E37 ||???????? ||ECCO:E37 ???????????????||ECCO:E37 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation.||||Jim: From GM Jiang Chuan's book <<????>>, one of the better manuals in the last few years. Commentary was provided by GM Jiang himself.||A very interesting game, showing how very quick the tides can change in XiangQi. This was one of the games from the 2008 ??? BeiLun Cup, which happened to be the National Masters Championships.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Countering the aggressive pawn with the cannon, would allow black to discourage and thus hamper the development of the left horse from H8+7. This would in turn create trouble in the speed of development of red's pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Playing the left side horse would allow red to resolve black's aggressions on the 3rd file, but at the same time, this side horse would be an issue to be resolved as it would slow its pace.||Red's left flank would become slow in development and that is why this variation has gradually been in decline the past few years.||Master Jin Song however, has achieved desirable results with this variation, after using it in competition for the past few years.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]H8+7 is another possibility but there has been a decline in use in the recent years.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14] And thus far, red has chosen a slow but deliberate pace. Red would now target black's horse on the rib file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]And black devised a strategy to sacrifice material first before gaining it back, along with other added bonuses.||This plan would also lessen the threat that red had placed on his horse on the rib file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red could have played C6=7 and still hold on to the pawn advantage going into midgame.||In actual play, however, red chose to attack the central pawn, choosing material advantage instead of developing his horses.||Perhaps he was not too concerned with  his horses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]As can be seen, black saw that the time was ripe for him to launch a counter offensive![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Black starts his campaign by pushing the chariot to red's throat rank, thereby harassing the two red horses and also search for any possible advantages.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Instinctively, R4=3 would seem to have been better.||Perhaps black chose to play this move because he felt that red's chariot would have trouble in returning to defend in time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]H3+4 would be ill-advised.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Red must have known of the implications and possibilities of playing R5-1.Red would not be satisified with the state of things should he have played R5-1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Black had the advantage now and would not be willing to surrender it so easily.||Black had held himself back from playing C8+1 as it would simplify the game. Playing C8+1 would also prevent black from making this H8+6 move. ||The tides seemed to be in black's favor now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]R5-2 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And after some analysis, blck felt that playing C8+5 would still result in black having a hard time trying to win.||That is perhaps why black decided to keep his options open by keeping the midgame complicated.||It was also a test of nerves and trying to sound red out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]E3+5 would have been much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42] This aggresive push by the pawn must have caused some pressure on red's formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]H2-1 would have provided better defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]H2-1 would notbe advised now![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]And black goes in for the final kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]K5=6 would lose red the horse, and the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And red resigned, seeing that it would be futile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_54]And black would be sure to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_48]And red's side horse would be under heavy attack.||Red would still be on the losing end.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]And red would still be safe for the time being![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]And this would have been a much better scenario for red than in the actual play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]And red would still live to fight another day![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]And it would be an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_43]And red would not be in immediate trouble.||This would be what red had hoped for.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_40]And red would have to sacrifice his pawn on the third rank to counter black's threat of capturing the horse with C4=8 and threatening to checkmate with H6+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_36]And black would threaten with R7=6 on the next move. This would cause all sorts of trouble for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_38]And the game would be up for grabs.||Black's riverbank horse would now cause much trouble for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_34]And black could be satisfied with this outcome, having captured the pawn on the 7th red file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_26]And black would be prepared to play H2+1.||Although red has gained the central pawn and also control of the central file, his formation would be in shambles.||Black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_9]A very aggressive and goal oriented move!||This would hamper black's left horse and allow red's horse in the same file to attack quickly.||More often than not, this right red horse would often be the deciding factor in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_17]And this would be a versatile counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_21]Black would seem to have a desirable and firm defense, but it would seem that black had been playing according to red's game plan and that is why this variation has gradually been dismissed in the recent years.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_21]
