[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120930 2006 Jiazhou Cup Hong Zhi W Yu Youhua C33 ||ECCO : C33 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement and Pawn Ranked Chariot vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Right Ranked Chariot. ||ECCO:C33 ????????????????||||Jim: Another board found on the internet. ||The commentator of the game was the winner of this game itself, GM Hong Zhi. This game was also briefly analysed in another book of mine. I have combined both comments.||I chose this game because the next section of opening theory by GM Liu Dianzhong is centered around the opening used in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red plays the 57 cannons, trying to add pressure to this file.||If red played H8+7, black would most probably answer with R1=4 and that would be another variation of its own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This was the last game in the last round of the Jiazhou Cup.||As seen from the picture, this move by GM Yu Youhua was rather unorthodox. He must have decided to try it on the last moment's notice.||The outcome of the game proved that this was not a  good move.||Most people would play E3-5...||Please click on the variation below to see it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Strong move!||If red were to accept the exchange offer, it would be an even game!||Jim: Pls click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Black is forced to sacrifice out of desperation.||If he chose to play H7-5 now, Red would have a seething attack going on!||Please click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]By advancing his pawn, black has offered an exchange of chess pieces.||Perhaps P6=5 would have been better, as although black would still be disadvantaged materially, the game would still be complex and he would still have a chance in this battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]By retreating the chariot to the throat rank, red snuffs out any attempt of a black counter and now has the game firmly in hand. An experienced move![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]As seen from the diagram, red has the material advantage now. By offering an exchange, red places black in a dilemma.||With this move, red forces black to use his pawn to exchange for the advisor, and after that, the game is basically decided.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment71]Red's horses are linked and thus protected.||Now, I prepare to try to capture the horse, and the pawns with this same move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]And now red's continues his attack.||Black would lose more material and the game is pretty much decided. ||The rest of the moves have been omitted.||Jim: The rest of the moves are found in my book, but not in this file from the internet. I have added them for your perusal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]And black decides that his situation is futile and decides to throw in the towel.||Red wins.[/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_74]Comment from another book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_75]And red would still be on the winning end too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_66]Comment from another book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_67]And red would still have the material advantage and be on the winning side.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]Red would have a seething attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]And it would be a 50/50 game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]Usually played variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]And red would still be in control of the game but black would still have a playable game on hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
