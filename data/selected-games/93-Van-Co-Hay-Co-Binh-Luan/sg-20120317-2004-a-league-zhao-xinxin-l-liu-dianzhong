[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120317 2004 A league Zhao Xinxin L Liu Dianzhong||ECCO:E37 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation.||ECCO:E37 ???????????????||This was a file found on the net. ||It was an annotated game of GM Zhao Xinxin vs GM Liu Dianzhong.  GM Zhao was a star on the rise then and had not made GM. GM Liu, on the other hand had been (and still is) a force to be reckoned with for the past 40 years.||Both players were well known for their aggressive styles of play and sure enough, this was a very very exciting. ||The comments were those of GM Zhuang Yuting.||GM Liu shows his midgame skills and wins in the end with a 1r2c combination kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Back then, playing the side horse was one of the ways that GM Zhao liked to play for this opening.||H2+3 is more commonly played though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]This was an improvement by GM Liu for this opening. ||A4+5 was more often played (it is still today).||Click on the variation to see it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Up till this stage, the two GMs go at it. And both seemed well prepared and satisfied with the opening thus far.  ||GM Zhuang mentioned in that this pawn ranked cannon move seemed questionable, as it would actually encourage black to play P3+1 and thus foil black's plan of attacking the center. ||It would also open up red's left flank for attack. ||GM Zhuang's suggested move was C8+1![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]GM Zhao chose to sacrifice his elephant with this move...||Click on the variation to understand what might have happened if he did not![/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Good move. ||Black eliminates the threat of red's cross river pawn in this exchange and does not hurry his attack. ||Red does not have any specific target to attack and black takes his time.||And as the game goes on, the lack of an elephant would prove detrimental to red's health![/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Red tries to look for more targets of attack with this move, but unfortunately, once the black chariot is freed, red would actually suffer instead. ||GM Zhuang suggested that red play C5=2 instead.||This way, although red would still be on th receiving end, black would still have to organize his troops before he could mount any decent attack. ||Red would still have a chance of a draw.||The black chariot would be like a tiger and when unleased....whew...[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]After the flurry of exchanges in the last few rounds, black shows his midgame aggressiveness.||The cannons are now in place and the chariot can gain back lost material any time he wants,.||Red can only manage a weak attack at this point.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]And GM Zhao resigns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]And black would gain material. It would not be too long before black wins.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]And black would have even better positioning of his chess pieces.||This is why GM Zhao chose to sacrifice the elephant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]This was suggested by GM Zhuang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]And red would have have a nice move with H9+7 to bring this horse into attack also.||Red would still have a strong attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_12]The more commonly played variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]This is one of the more commonly played variation, but red would have one more pawn and still hold the minor lead in the game. ||For GM Liu, being on the receiving end of things was something that he detested ... ||GM Liu was VERY VERY well known for his aggressive style of play![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_5]Another commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]At this stage, red has C9=6 and C5=6 as further options. ||But GM Liu was also very well versed in these two variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]
