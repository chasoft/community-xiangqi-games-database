[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130414 2008 Zhao XinXin L Lv Qin E47||||ECCO:E47 ??????????||ECCO:E47 Pawn with Thundering Defense variation vs Pawn with Right Central Cannon variation||||Jim: This is one of the most exciting matches that I have seen in some time. Commented by GM Jiang Chuan in his book.||||This was one of the more exciting matchups in the 2008 National Singles Championships, and it was for the 3rd placing.||In the first match between this two GMs, the game had ended in a draw after a bloody fight. After a short rest, this game of rapid chess was played and GM Zhao took red again.||Another gruesome battle. But the old GM showed his stuff and won eventually.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]And red chose to play an aggressive and fast variation with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And GM Lv counters with the central cannon to allow developement of his left horse and also, at the same time, decrease the efficiency of red's C2=3.||C2=5 is also another big variation of its own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]P3+1 to sacrifice the center is another very aggressive and complicated variation![/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]H2+1 is another possible variation. Red would usually counter with A6+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]R1=8 is another possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red cannot play A4+5 now because black can threaten to play R8+7 and red's formation would be broken.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Both players showed their delicate side in thinking up till this move. Neither players refused to follow the opponent's play and preferred to hoard their pieces up and potential up. ||This would be contrary to GM Lv's style of play, but in this game of lightning chess, it was necessary.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And red prepares to sacrifice his 7th pawn, so that the battle focus would be on this file.||Of course R6+3 would also have a similar effect...[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And GM Lv chooses the Taichi way of play. Black refuses to answer face-on red's aggressions and call for battle, and gingerly makes this move.||Jim: When the cannons are placed in the palace corner in this manner, they are known as the tiger eyed cannons. I recall GM Lv doing the same thing in another game over a decade ago, maybe one of these days I will dig it out and share. Until then...enjoy the taichi...[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red proceeds to advance the pawn, hoping to open up black's defense. The young GM shows his impatience here. ||This would seem a little bit rash now.||R6+3 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And red goes along for the ride!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]R8+3 is another possibility.||Jim: GM Jiang does not further elaborate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black does not play R8=6 and chooses to attack from the side files.||In the game of rapid chess, choosing the less complicated variations is also a wise choice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]P1+1 would probably lead to a situation whereby red would not be satisfied.||That is probably why he chose this move instead.||But in retrospect on how the game ended, this would seem to be a foolhardy move too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]H3+5 would not seem to be desirable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And after this move, black has managed to seize control of the game and all of red's initiative had been reduced to nil.||Red's predicament has gotten from bad to worse and the pressure he was facing was mounting.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]This would seem a little bit conservative. ||H2+4 would be more aggressive![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]Black has not been able to find any good places to  put place his pieces, and that gave red a  breather.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment59]As can be seen, if one took time to analyze carefully, it would not be hard to see that black has a solid defense. ||It would be very hard to try to do anything when black's chariot has defended the pawn rank so well. ||Red must have lost his cool and made the wrong assumption. Red would have to pay dearly for his brashness and it also showed that red was not in the correct frame of mind.||Jim: Remember, this was a game of rapid chess![/DhtmlXQ_comment59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]Red sees that red is prepared to attack and captures the central pawn instead!!!||Very bold play.||Black allowed red to attack first before taking care of red's eventual elbow horse check.||Cool, calm and collected play from black![/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]Both sides have been going at it and the situation has become very complex.||Black took a gamble and starts his counter.||There is no turning back.[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]Red's earlier elbow horse check does not create much trouble for red. Instead, it allowed black to position this horse appropriately, giving it something to do. This would also snub out red's offense and with this move, it signals the end of red's offense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment71]Red's psyche was full of ambition and aggression, while black took things one at a time very calmly.||Red's patience was slowly eroded bit by bit as time went on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]And black could not be bothered with R9=8 which would give red an opportunity for a breather.||Instead, black targeted the red horse and was prepared to send it back to the stables.||Jim: ok, part of the translations were mine but you get the picture...the end is near for red...[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]H6+5 would also be a win for black, but it would take longer.[/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment80]And black denies red any more chance of an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]And in the end, red ran out of ammunition and was unable to carry on.||For me (GM Jiang Chuan), this game had the following inspirations.||A young tiger tried to pick a fight everywhere but the old (relatively...) king of the hill took his time and accumulated enough potential to strike his opponent down, just in one blow.||When the experts go at it, they NEVER pull out their knives and start chopping incessantly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_86]And black would still win eventually.||But black did not want the game to even reach the endgame stage, preferring to end the game in midgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_59]And after black played P5+1, red could continue with H6+8. ||This would lead to a completely different outcome for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]And from the looks of things, red's sacrifice would not be able to do much.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]And red could not be satisfied with this outcome either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_25]And red would have lost the initiative in the game, but black would have a hard time trying to crack red's defense too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]This is to give the reader some food for thought on another way of developing red's forces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_12]And just only a few moves in the game, both kings have been moved. The intensity and ferocity of this variation is not for the weak of heart. It could be anybody's game and unless absolutely necessary, red would not be willing to give up control of this game so easily.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_12]
