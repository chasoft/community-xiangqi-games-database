[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120914 1999 Slc Hong Zhi D Liu Dianzhong C45||C45 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement and Pawn ranked chariot vs Screen Horse Defense with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation. ||ECCO:C45 ?????????????????||Jim: This annotated game was provided by Mr Chris Hankinson and is a perfect upload in view of my recent boards on openings by GM Liu Dianzhong. ||This match was played in January 1999 at Xingyang, Henan Provice. For those that do not know, Xiangyang was the place where the legendary Xiang Yu ?? did battle against his arch nemesis Liu Bang??. ||The event was the first ever Shaolin Autombile Cup and participants eligible to take part were of the highest caliber. Only the top 48 ranked players according to the ranking systems then were able to participate, and for those who could not make it, the next in ranked player would take the place. It was one of the toughest competition of its era.||The competition was held in two different stages. In the first stage, players were divided into 8 groups, playing a round robin each. The winner of the round robin would then be eligible for the second round whereby the players played in a double disqualification match to progress.||At the end of the day, the placings were as follows:||Champion: Lv Qin||1st Runner Up: Zhao Guorong, ||2nd Runner Up:Liu Dianzhong.||3rd to 8th place were Liu Dahua, Li Laiqun, Chen Xiaokun Xu Tianhong Huang Shiqing in that order. ||This game was played in the 3rd round in one of the groups. Hong Zhi (who would later become a GM also) was the second seed in that group and was a strong, respectable opponent. Hong is known for his rutheless attacking capabilitis, supreme precision in the calculation of his moves and had very strong midgame abilities. ||This was no doubt the most important match in that group and the winner would most likely proceed to the second round.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Jim: For beginners new to the site, please go through the openings series that I have uploaded from 11th-13th of Sept 2012. Or go to the menu bar and clik on the "Opening theory by GM Liu Dianzhong", and then choose the first few boards of Chapter two.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]When playing this variation ( C9+4), red shows that he has opted for a fierce attacking game. The variations that follow are very complex. It is a sign that red is prepared to fight til the very end.||Black P7+1 is a commonly played encounter.||Other options for black at this stage would be C7+5 or C2+4.  ||It is easy to sIn this variation,[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And red starts his aggressions by capturing the central pawn.||Playing C5+4 is a relatively new variation that started in back in the 90's. ||In the past, C9=5 was played.||Please click on the variation below...[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And black moves the right elephant to the center. If black chose his left elephant , please click on the variation below to understand what would happen.||Jim: For beginners, in Xiangqi, almost everything is relative. That is why, the right elephant for black would seen as the elephant that would indeed be on black's right hand side, which would be red's left hand side in this case. ||Please note that this variation is different from the variation whereby red attacks the central pawn with the side cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Please click on the variation to see what would happen if black chose C2+4 instead... ||Other often played moves for black include H3+5/R8+3 and C2+6, which are not discussed in this board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Black accepts the challenge.||R2=1 would not be wise!||Pls click on the variation below to understand the GM's viewpoint...[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Black immediately attacks the red chariot to sound  his attack. This is a commonly played move.||Another option would be to play R8+8 ...||Please click on the variation below to understand why ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]R3=4 would be suicidal for red!||Please click on the vairiation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Red's cannon and chariot are on the same file. This was a very good move, as it not only prevents the black chariot from moving to the right (black's right = red's left), it also indirectly limits the movement of the black pieces.||Black is already down 3 pawns, and if play were to continue at this pace, black would be in trouble.||That is why the only way out for black would be to  attack from the side.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Black decides to let the black side horse to join in the fray.||R6+4 would not be ok!!!||Please click on the variation to understand why.||There have been other instances of players playing H9-8 followed by H8+7. This option is worth exploring.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]Red could have played P7+1 on the previous move.||As black could not checkmate with the current state of affairs, black had to defend by offering this exchange. ||The tide has changed and now black would try to go for a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]Red has a three pawn advantage going into endgame.||Although black's 1r1h1c combination is slightly superior to reds's 1r2h combination, it is hard for black to organize any attack that would be effective and black would have a hard time trying even for a draw.||Red shows his brilliance with this move, pinning the black chariot and threatening to play R2-3 to eliminate the horse.||Brilliant play from red!.[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]As seen in this diagram, red attempts to capture the black horse, unaware that black had a surprise move. Black could have sacrificed his horse first before simplifying the game and then capturing back lost material.||Perhpas red could have played R2-2 ...||Please click on the variation on the next move to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]This was the actual move played...[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]And after a series of exchanges, the endgame is reached with red's 1r1h2p2a2e vs black's 1r1c2a2e.||Although red had two more pawns, but they have yet to cross the river.||Black on the other hand, has defended well.||The chances of forcing a draw were thus greatly increased.[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment102]And black retreats the central elephant. ||Not only does black have an attack now, black is sure to win an advisor.||The chances for the game to end in a draw were greatly increased.[/DhtmlXQ_comment102]
[DhtmlXQ_comment118]Black was rash to have tried to win another advisor.||R6=2 would have been a better move, forcing a draw faster.[/DhtmlXQ_comment118]
[DhtmlXQ_comment140]In retrospect, this move was useless. I should have played R4-4 and it would have been easier to force a draw then.[/DhtmlXQ_comment140]
[DhtmlXQ_comment160]Because of black's earlier folly, although black had gained an extra elephant, but the position of red's chess pieces were getting better.||Black would have trouble trying to force a draw now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment160]
[DhtmlXQ_comment165]Red rushed his moves by advancing this horse.||P3+1 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment165]
[DhtmlXQ_comment166]And black seized the chance to try to force a draw by retreating this chariot to the cannon rank.||Black would now try to exchange chariots to force the game into a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment166]
[DhtmlXQ_comment179]Black made use of the fact that red had only one elephant left and starts his defence witht his move.||Red feared that he would lose more if he did not exchange chariots.||The endgame was now further simplified to that of 1h2p1e vs 1c2a2e.||Red trys to move his king to this rib file to try to make use of his positional advantage to launch his final attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment179]
[DhtmlXQ_comment200]And the game was a draw.||The rest of the moves have been omitted.||In this game, red tried a relatively new variation and had a pawn advantage early in the game. ||Althouth black tried attack after attack in midgame, black was still unable to win and was eventually forced to exchange his cannons. ||It was a hard battle to force a draw for black but red made a mistake in endgame by advancing his horse too rapidly. ||Black pounced on the chance and succeeded in simplifying the engame to that of a draw.||It was a hard earned draw for black.||Jim: Whew...and it was hard translating this game....but well worth it! Brilliant play by the two GMs (Hong Zhi made GM in 2005 I think!).[/DhtmlXQ_comment200]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_122]The horse would be lost easily. This way, the game would not have dragged!||Jim: for beginners, black could play C5+6 or C5=6 to capture the horse so that the game would simplify to a drawish situation![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_122]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_74]This was what red had thought that black would move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_77]And red would now have the game firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_63]And black would run out of ammunition.||Red would now win as black is unable to resolve the iron bolt checkmate (red R6+5).[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_56]And black successfully pushes a pawn across the river. This variation actually played in another game.||Red's left flank is congested and this pawn will be worth its weight in gold. ||Black has the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_54]And black would be sure to gain material!||Jim: I have tried to add the variations to show what the GM meant...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_56]And black captures the red horse with this check.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_58]Again black gains a horse with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_56]Preparing to check with A5+6 or H7+6...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_60]Red loses the orse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_60]And red loses the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]And black would have the option of C7=6 on the next move, providing heavy artillery.||This variation first appeared in 1999 Team Championships and is worth studying. ||Time will judge whether it is a good move or not, or if any other interesting would arise in this situation![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_34]Not advisable...[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_39]And the game would be a test of speed for both sides. Red would be superior as his chess pieces have more room to maneuver and more options to both defend and attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_31]And red would have the advantage with the pawns![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_29]And red would be better off!||Please note that this variation is different from the variation whereby red plays C9=5 to attack the central pawn instead of C5+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_30]If black tried to play this move as in C9=5 variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_31]Red could now answer with this move and negate whatever black had been planning, making black's R8=6 move obsolete.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_41]And it would be a relatively even game with high chances of a draw. ||This would not be what Hong Zhi hoped for!||Jim: Please refer to page 3 of opening series by GM Liu Dianzhong whereby the variations are explained in greater detail.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_41]
