[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130204 2006QiXin Hong Zhi W Zhao GuoRong E34||2006?????????????||????????||||ECCO:E34 ???????????????||ECCO:E34 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon Variation vs  Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation||||Jim: Found this game played rather recently in the 2006 QiXin Golf Cup. GM Hong Zhi took on GM Zhao GuoRong. I searched through my books and found a similar commented game by Sun ZhiWei and Liu HaiTing. The internet commentary was given by Master Zhao QingGe. I have combined their commentaries, with Z to present the comments by Zhao and SL to represent the comments by Sun and Liu.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Jim: GM Hong Zhi is well know for his Angel's Pawn  opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Z: Black gains a slight advantage in material with this variation while red gets to mobilize his troops faster. These are the pros and cons for each side.   ||SL: This game was played in round 12 in the 2006 QiXin Golf Cup (A League Tournament). ChongQing's GM Hong Zhi went up against HeiLongJiang's GM Zhao GuoRong, and both players began the game with the Angel's Pawn vs Thundering Defense. ||Black advances the pawn for an exchange and opts for an immediate material gain.||R9+1 is another huge variation which a different set of rules for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]SL:Red opts for material with this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Z: No matter what happens, black cannot allow red to play C1+3! If red were able to move C1+3, he would be prepared to play C8+5 on the next move to attack the central elephant and black's would be under heavy attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Z: Black's pawn would seemed to have made too many moves in the opening stages of the game, and has affected the development of the other chess pieces. However, R4+4 would give red the advantage.||Click on the variation to see Master Zhao's explanation, which are identical to Sun and Liu's explanation!  ||||SL: Black advances his pawn to keep his options open. If black tried R4+4 instead, red would still have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Z: Black traverses the cannon to protect his cross river pawn indirectly. If red does take the horse with H9+7, black would play C7+4 to threaten with a smothered cannon checkmate and thus capture the horse...BUT..[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Z: Red decides to sacrifice his horse anyway!!!||This sacrifice tactic is different from the usual tactics employed whereby one would get to launch a series of attacks after the sacrifice. Neither will it allow red to regain material a few moves later and have the advantage. The main idea behind this sacrifice is to control and limit the development of the black chess pieces. In exchange for this horse, red would now have spatial advantage and would try to exploit it in the moves to come. ||||SL: Red uses his horse to capture the pawn, preparing to sacrifice it for a gain in tempo. This is a very proactive and aggressive approach to the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Zhao: GM Hong now further limits the movement of the black cannon as it cannot play C4=9 now. This would free his horse on the 7th file to start his attack.||SL: This is an improvment of C8-4 which was the move to make in the past.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]SL: Red's attack on black's horse would result in an unprotected black chariot. It would also trap the black chariot. This is a good move for red to increase his tempo and control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Z: And after black is forced to move the horse, the side chariot is trapped and limited as it cannot move. The function of this side chariot is reduced to practically nothing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Z: And this was what I meant by red having the spatial advantage. Red gets to charge his central pawn forward for attack. Black, on the other hand, was forced to move his pawn and chariot too many times and that greatly reduced his tempo. ||Red's army looks very menacing now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Z: GOOD MOVE! Not only does red prevent his chariot from being attacked, he still does not give black any chance of developing his chariot(s).[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]SL: As can be seen, the red central pawn has now crossed the river and one can feel that the momentum of the game is basically red's. The pawn can now control the riverbank and would allow red to conjure up many plans to gain back loss material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]SL: Very delicate and polished move from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]SL: Good move from red! Although the effects of this move may not be appreciated at this moment, it is a very powerful move![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Z: If black chose to play C4-2, red would gain back lost material and have the obvious advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]SL: And red regains lost material, thereby increasing his hold on the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]Z: In the past few moves, red has captured the black cannon, attacked the black chariot while at the same time adjusted his formation brilliantly.||Since his sacrifice in the opening, red has exploited his spatial advantage brilliantly up till this move.||Faced with such a situation, even if the late Northwest expert Peng ShuSheng ???, or the late XiangQi King of the 7 Provinces Zhou DeYu ??? were still around, they would have exclaimed " Wow, I never knew that sacrifices could be made in such a manner!" ||Jim: Master Zhao is quite old himself. I do not know if he is still around... but the players he mentioned were the players that were looked up too  in the first half of the 20th century.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]SL: And black decided to counter sacrifice a horse, hoping that his attack would be fruitful and be able to salvage his dire situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]Z: During the past few moves, both players went at each other, punch for punch. The moves played would seem to be in a disarray and rash. This could be attributed to the fact that both sides were now in time trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment72]Z: It would seem quite out of the ordinary that black chose to retreat his chariot instead of capturing the red cannon with H6+7. ||But on further analyses, black would lose the game if he did so!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment76]SL: Red would still be faster in the attack should black chose to play R4+3![/DhtmlXQ_comment76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment83]SL: Red's decision to sacrifice his cross river pawn is indication that he has full confidence that his 1r1h1c combination would be faster than black in the kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment93]Z: A very important move from red. He does not forget to defend even when things are to his advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment93]
[DhtmlXQ_comment103]Z: With this move, black is denied a cannon mount, thereby dismantling black's offense.||If this move was not made, black could attack with  R2+3 K6+1, followed by H6+5 and red would still be in trouble and it could still be anybody's game!||SL: Red prevents a potential kill by black with this move. He does not forget to defend even when attacking. This is the mark of an experienced player![/DhtmlXQ_comment103]
[DhtmlXQ_comment113]Z: Good move by red![/DhtmlXQ_comment113]
[DhtmlXQ_comment114]SL: Red would still be faster if black chose H6+8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment114]
[DhtmlXQ_comment117]Z: And red starts his final onslaught with the octagonal horse![/DhtmlXQ_comment117]
[DhtmlXQ_comment121]Z: Red now threatens to checkmate with R6=5.||SL: And black resigned. ||Jim: I have added the final moves by Zhao, Sun and Liu to explain why black resigned![/DhtmlXQ_comment121]
[DhtmlXQ_comment123]Jim: And black would not be able to prevent Red's R6=4 checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment123]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_115]SL: And red would still be faster in attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_83]SL: And red would still be faster in the kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_77]And red would now threaten to checkmate with C1+5 AND R7+8 at the same time.||Black would not be able to resolve both attacks and thus lose![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_73]Z: Or red could choose to play it safe with this move as the would still have control of the game firmly in hand![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_69]SL: And red would be prepared to move H3+1! on the next move. Black would be in all sorts of trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]Z: red would gain back lost material and have the obvious advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]SL: And black could counter with this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_44]SL: And black could counter with this move to get himself out of trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]SL: And it would often lead to an even game for both. One player would have the material advantage  but the other player would have control of the game firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]Master Zhao and Sun and Liu's explanations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]Z: And red would be able to capture black's cross river pawn and have the advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_25]SL: And at this stage in the game, it would be relatively equal for both sides. Red would have the pawn advantage but black would have a threatening cross river pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_13]SL: And this variation would have its own set of rules for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_13]
