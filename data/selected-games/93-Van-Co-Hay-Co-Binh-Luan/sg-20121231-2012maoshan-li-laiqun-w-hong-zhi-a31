[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121231 2012MaoShan Li LaiQun W Hong Zhi A31||||ECCO:A31 ??????????||ECCO:A31 Elephant opening with Rt proper horse vs Left Cross Palace Cannon ||Jim: This game was published very recently in XiangQi. The competition was the 2012 MaoShan Cup whereby only National Champions were allowed to participate. It was a top notch competition. In the male division, Hu Ronghua, Liu Dahua, Li LaiQun, Lv Qin, Xu TianHong, Zhao GuoRong, Xu YinChuan, Tao HanMing, Yu YouHua, Hong Zhi, Zhao XinXin, Jiang Chuan and Sun YongZheng partiicpated. In the end, Lv Qin won the coveted trophy, while Xu YinChuan and Sun YongZheng came in 2nd and 3rd place respectively. 4th to 6th placings were Zhao Xinxin, Hu RongHua and Jiang Chuan. This competition managed to gather the most number of National Champions, past and present. ||Commentary was presented by Master Ge WeiPu.||And GM Li LaiQun comes out of semi-retirement to show his stuff in this game!||||This was the 4th ever MaoShan Cup whereby only National Champions were eligible for participation. This was one of the matches that was played in round one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]H7+8 is another alternative to prevent black from playing R1=2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Black could also consider playing P1+1 to develop his side horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]A silky move from red, preventing development of black's side horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And black took a risk with this move.||For players who prefer less excitment, black could consider playing R2=3 first to develop this chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]If red played K5=6 to capture the cannon, black would counter with R2=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]Black could also choose to play C7=8 to block red's cannon. That would be a more steadfast option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]This is to prevent red from playing C1+3 to attack the bottom rank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]Black could have considered playing C1-4 to gain the side pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]Red could also consider playing H3+2 for the riverbank horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]And red sacrifices the horse for the attack. This seemed to be a little bit rash. H3-1 to conserve material would allow red more options going into endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]And black should have taken the horse with C7+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]Big mistake by black! This would cost black the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]And red is basically assured of victory after this move is played![/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment89]Red should have played H5+7 to deliver a check. That would have led to a faster kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment105]And black resigned.||Jim: Afterword, GM Li LaiQun had been the National Champion for 4 times and many (including me) think that he is one of the greatest ever. GM Li had retired from XiangQi in the earlier 90's to make his name in real estate and has since become a real estate tycoon and he had used his earnings to sponsor quite a few major competitions. Since the 90's he has participated in competition occasionally but still writes occasional columns or comments in various periodicals. Coming out of retirement to participate in this tournament was quite a big draw for XiangQi lovers everywhere.[/DhtmlXQ_comment105]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_89]Move suggested by Master Ge.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_91]And red would be win faster.||Jim: I have tried to add the final moves to the kill to show the beginner why.||Red threatens to mate with R4+1 K5-1, R4+1 K5+1,  and R4-1 for the kill now. ||If black played the central elephant, black would lose the chariot and red would win in just a matter of time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_91]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_93]And now red would threaten to mate with R4-1 AND R4=6 for the kill. Black would not be able to resolve both threats at once.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_93]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_94]And black would be better with the material advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_82]And black would have more material and also the advantage going into endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_71]And it would still be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]Another possible alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]And red would still have the lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]
