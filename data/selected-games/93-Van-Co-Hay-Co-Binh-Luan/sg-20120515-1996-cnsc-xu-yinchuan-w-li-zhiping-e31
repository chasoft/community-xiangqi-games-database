[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120515 1996 cnsc Xu Yinchuan W Li Zhiping E31||||ECCO:E31 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon Variation vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation. ||ECCO:E31 ???????????????||||This was another game played by GM Xu in the 1996 Chinese National Singles Championships. His opponent was Master Li Zhiping from Hubei Province. Comments were provided by GM Xu himself and given in quotation marks. ||||"It was the 5th round of the National Championships and my opponent was Master Li Zhiping from Hubei. Master Li had achieved very good results ever since he made his his presence on the Xiangqi scene in 1988 (?). One of the more remarkable matches was his draw against Lv Qin in the last round of 1994 Chinese National Singles Tournament. GM Lv was the defending champion that year. Should Lv had won, he would have been champion. But a draw left Lv runner up. Li made Xiangqi master that year with that draw has he was placed 8th. ||Master's Li's style of play is less aggressive and indirect. You never know what he is thinking off.. He has very strong Xiangqi foundations and is one of the more talented players of his generation.||Prior to this encounter, I had decided to include an element of surprise in this match..."||||Jim: Master Li was born in 1972. His best result in the National Singles Tournament was 3rd place in 1996. He was also a key player on the Hubei team, where he still renders his service to, when they won the National Team Championships in 2005.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]"By playing P7+1 for the first move, I wanted to see what Black had been preparing for, and then adjust my opening accordingly. If black answered with the proper horse or the elephant, it would mean that the actual battle field would be in the midgame and endgame. If Black answered with the central cannon, anything could happen. As there are so many variations to this opening, the pawn opening has been given the nice name of Angel's Guide (WXF recommendations).||Black's C2=3 is very target oriented and is one of the best and most commonly used counters against he Angel's Pawn. It has also been given the poetic name of "Roaring Thunder",�???. By playing this cannon, red would have been slowed in playing H8+7 ... "||Please click on the variation to see what GM Xu had written.||||????,???????,???????????????????????????,???????,??????,???????�????�??????????,????,????????3?1,????,?3?1,????,?7?5,????????????????,???�???�??????????????,??????????????[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]"By playing the central cannon now, Red applies pressure on black's center. This is also one of the more commonly used red variations.||Some readers might ask, why not C8=5 then, as the center would still be under attack?"||||Please click on the variations suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]"And it becomes an all out fight very quickly. If black plays R9+1, ...the game would still be a 'closed' one."||||Please click on the variation below to see what GM Xu had suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]"This was my surprise for red! In the past, H8+9 was habitually played. This move of mine was not played in the past. I believe it is the responsibility of a Xiangqi Master to show creativity in the opening. On one hand, it is the only way to stay ahead of the competition. On the other hand, the art of Xiangqi is dependent on the creativity of the moves played. Therefore, I believe that good Xiangqi players must possess some of the attributes that artists have: deep thought, focus, creativity etc. On the flip side, when a player is not able to show new moves, and follows the norm, it shows that his creativity is stifled..||The best living example of Xiangqi creativity is GM Hu Ronghua, perhaps the greatest player of all time. From the period of time when he was till young till the time when he was at his peak, his Xiangqi never stopped showing creativity. Breathing life into new variations showed his artistry and bring immense happiness to him and all others. At the same time, it caused his opponents to have a constant headache. Even at his  current age, GM Hu still shows much creativity and his games still often show moves that do not conform to accepted norms. ||Even though his stamina was a fraction of what he used to be,the fight in him and extraordinary creativity still allowed him to become the National Champion in 1997, and even to beat all other competitors in teh 17th 5 Rams Cup. What an extraordinary achievement!"||Jim: GM Hu won the National Singles Championships again at 2000. This article was written before 2000.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]"Master Li thought for over 20 minutes before answering my move. There were many options for him, like playing P3+1 or develop his left or right flank as he deemed. Master Li was faced with a myriad of choices, and in light of the gravity of this competition, he must have had a huge pyschological burden. If we were in his shoes with time pressure, could we have made a better choice?"[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]"In light of the complex possibilities, the young Matster shows fear with this move. Although the pawn has crossed the river, it does not dare to advance for fear of a trap. Being cautious is important in chess, but in this instance, P3+1 would be better."||||Please click on the variation to see GM Xu's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]" The experienced Master Li becomes doubtful again. It is evident in the game that black has already invested 3 moves on the black cross river pawn, thereby slowing down the development of the other major pieces. Allowing this precious pawn to be simply caught with this move would further devastate black's condition.||Black could have played R1=2 to protect the pawn..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]"The pawn that has crossed the river has been given up unconditionally. The mobility of the red's pieces are gradually evident after this move. ||If Black played H4+3... "||Please click on the variation below to see what GM Xu had in mind.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]"A very important move to block black's right chariot and to prevent black from developing his horse with H6+7. This move basically gives red the  distinct advantage. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]"If R1=2 ..."||Please click on the variation below to see why black would still be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]"At this point in time, both of red's cannons threaten black with a smothered cannon checkmate. They also manage to corner the black chariot. As they serve so many purposes, it would be natural that I did not want to give them up. ||The same combination of chess pieces have different value at different locations on the board. This is something that the beginner must learn. Once you learn this, you would then know when it would be favourable to simplify the game, or when to keep it complicated. " ||||Jim: Good advice![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]"As seen from the diagram, red does not have any obvious weakness and is slowly pushing his troops forward. Perhaps of the stress that Master Li was under, he gradually lost his cool and made this mistake again. This would be the final nail in the coffin.||Black should have played R8=6 to adopt a wait and see strategy. Red would still have to be very precise in his attack with little room for error in order to go for a win."||Please click on the variation below to see GM Xu's recommendations :[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]"Maybe Master Li did not see this move coming. If black continued to play R3+2 ...."||||?????????????????3?2,?????,?7?2,????,????????????,??????[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]" Once black's cannon on the 7th file has been exchanged, his defence crumbles apart. Red seizes the opportunity and attacks mercilessly, giving black no breathing time. If red chose to play R7=9 on this move, black would answer with R7=3. Although red would still hold on to the lead, black would have some time to catch his breath. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]"Black tries this last ditch attempt."[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]" If black played R3+7 ...."[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]"And black resigned after being unable to find a solution to counter red's R4+2 on the next move.||Looking back at this game, it was over quite soon. As can be seen, the psychological effects of a new move and the stresses of competition can be a determining factor in a game.||However, once any new variation is played, the whole Xiangqi world would know and people would soon find ways to counter this move...Therefore, only do we keep trudging on, keep on creating, can we try to stay in front of the pack in Xiangqi. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_47]"And red would be prepared to go for the throat cutting checkmate."||Jim: I have added the following moves to show the beginner what Xu meant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]This would be the throat cuttinc checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]And black would still be unable to escape red's R5+1 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]"And all of red's chess pieces would be ready to join in the attack soon. Black would lose very soon."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]"And red could take his time to play H3+2. Black would still be unable to have any good moves."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]"And red would still have the distinct advantage!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]"And black would still be in trouble! "[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]" And black would still be in lots of trouble!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]"and although the pawn would stil be lost, but black more than makes up for it in the development of his other chess pieces!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]" And although the development of black's other pieces are still slow, the presence of the cross river pawn makes black's game not too bad after all. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_10][advised counter][/DhtmlXQ_comment10_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]"And it would still be a rather even game. This was the counter that black should have played. The moves given were the result of analysis of this game."[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_10]" And the tempo of the game would still be slow and deliberate..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_8]"And red would not gain much..."||Jim: Black would have better development, a pawn that has crossed the river and many ways to skin the solitary horse, without backup, in its territory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_12]"And it would be a relatively even game. Both sides are near identical images of each other. However, in retrospect, by playing C8=5, red's first move of P7+1 would be inefficient and would not seem to do much. On the other hand, black has already moved the ranked chariot, ready to control the rib files and has P3+1 has powerful counters.||That is perhaps why C8=5 has gradually declined in popularity over the years. "||||Jim: for beginners, the WXF calls the 4th and 6th files the armpit files. I prefer the rib files.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_18]"And black would have wrestled control of the game away from red. "||||Red has spent too many moves on the pawn which does not seem to do much at the moment; at the cost of the other major pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_5]"This variation was provided by Master Yan Wenqin in the early 90's. The line of thinking behind this variation is that red allows black's pawn to cross the river, in exchange for faster development of his chess pieces..."||||Jim: this variation is still often played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_5]
