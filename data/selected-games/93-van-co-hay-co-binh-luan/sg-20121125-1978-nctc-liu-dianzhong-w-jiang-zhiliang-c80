[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121125 1978 nctc Liu DianZhong W Jiang ZhiLiang C80||||ECCO:C80 ?????????||ECCO : C80 Central Cannon with Riverbank Cannon Variation vs Screen Horse Defense.||||Jim: I managed to find this annotated game in my database. This was an actual game that was played in the 1978 Chinese National Team Championships.||Red was GM Liu DianZhong while black was famous Xq Master Jiang ZhiLiang from Anhui province at that time. Commentary was provided by GM Wang JiaLiang and famous Xq author Jin QiChang.||This board coincides with the opening boards that I have uploaded recently. ||A practical example to show the theory that has been taught by GM Liu.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red chooses to play H8+7 instead of R2+6, preferring a balanced development of his chess pieces over a quick attack. ||R2+6 would lead to another different scenario.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And black tries to be proactive with this move: the left cannon blocakde.||C2+4 is another feasible option, as if red answers with P5+1, red could then play this move for the fiery Screen Horse Defense with double cross river cannon variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And the general opening is now fixed. Red has chosen the Riverbank Cannon variation fo the Central Cannon, whil black has chosen the Screen Horse Defense as a counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black chooses a volatile variation with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And red plays it cautiously by retreating the horse first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]The red horse cannot escape. Black chooses the cross-riverbank chariot to try to gain control of the riverbank.||However, Red could counter with P5+1 (and he does), and after that, black would be at a disadvantage. R8+4 to patrol the riverbank on black's side of the river would seem to be a more feasible move![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]A good move by red to exten his lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Great move by black. With this move, red forces black to use his chariot to exchange for the horse![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Jim: Red threatens to checkmate with the palcorner horse, and also to lose his chariot with C8=2. That is why black must use his chariot to exchange for the central horse. Red has the lead in the game firmly in control now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Jim: Or red would play C5-4 to eliminate the central pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]C2+4 would be a better alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]If black were to go for the exchange, black's remaining 1h1c1p would  find it a hard time to try to defend against 1r1c1p![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]Jim: For beginners, red cannot be greedy and try to gain material now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]And after the exchange, red's remaining 1r2p is more than sufficient to win against black's 1h2a2e![/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment89]Black resigned.||If black played P1+1 ...please click on the moves below.||If black does not do so, red would play R8+2 and capture the side pawn.||Red would win anyhow and that is why black resigned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment93]And the black horse is captured for sure.||1r1p would be more than sufficient against black's 2a2e.[/DhtmlXQ_comment93]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]And red's advantage would be reduced to nothing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_42]Suggested move by GM Wang and Jin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]And black would be better off as he has still the two cross river pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]And red would be very much in the lead![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
