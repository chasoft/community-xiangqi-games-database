[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121112 2007 7Star Cup GM Xu Yinchuan W GM Liu Dianzhong C39||||ECCO:C39 ?????????????????||ECCO C39 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation||||?????? ??? ? ?????? ???||||||Jim: This was a file found over the internet. It also conforms to the opening variations introduced thus far. Red is GM Xu Yin Chuan while black is GM  Liu Dianzhong. This file appears to have been an interview of GM Xu by female GM You Yinqin and their discussion of the board is given.||Xu: The left riverhorse variation is one of GM Liu's more familiar openings. He had authored a book �???�( The left riverbank horse variation). I had read that book when I was young, although I cannot remember most of the variations now. ||You: Well, it shows that the variations do not post too much a problem to you now!||Xu: I can only recall some of the more major variations and the more fashionable ones.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]"One of GM's Liu more familiar openings!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Xu: Using the 59 Cannons to attack the left riverbank horse is one of the major variations that red can use. The characteristic of this attack is that it is more balanced. In the past, C8+1 was once very fashiobable. And although it would lead to a very aggressive game, red would be able to control the game under most circumstances.||You: GM Yang Guanlin seems to favor this opening too.||Xu: Oh, he prefers to play black for study purposes, but seldom plays the red variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17] Xu: For this move, one could also choose to play R2=8. During the compeition, I looked at the board ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Xu: In the past, someone had played R1+2 instead of R1=2. I think Jiang Chuan (GM) and Huang Hailin (Master) had done so, but I cannot recall the details of the moves. The main idea behind R1+2 is to allow black one more option of C8-1.||But GM Liu does not like cramped play. He prefers open games with much aggression.||You: Looks like you know our teacher much better than us!!! ( GM You is one of the many masters and gms under Liu's tutelage.)[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Xu: When the game reached this stage, it became very complex. GM Liu was playing black, and could have tried for a draw, but he did not play passively and instead, played very aggressively. I felt that he was even more aggressive than me (laughing)...[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Xu: This is a very good move!!! Playing C2-1 now would be less ideal. I think that GM Liu had played this move in the past, and it was against GM Xu Tianhong. I think GM Xu had played R8+6 P6=5, C5=3, and it was quite a complex game too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Xu: During actual play, I did not know if this was feasible but tried this H6+4 move anyway. ||You: This move does not seemed to have been played before in the past. Was it one of your secret weapons?||Xu: No, no, no! To be frank, I had thought that H6+4 might be feasible but during actual competition, when GM Liu played C2+1, I said to myself " Oh dear!!! ". GM Liu had P5+1 as a power continuation. I really had not expected C2+1, and that goes to show how incomplete my study of this game was...[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Xu: If black were allowed to play P5+1 to simplify the game, I would not be able to control the game to my advantage anymore. That is why after some thought, I decided to push my pawn across the river first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Xu: By playing this move, I had hoped to keep the game as tight as possible, keeping black on his toes. In this sort of games, as there is too much material and both sides are having a tense game, it would be hard to make the correct analysis. It must be commended that GM Liu played very proactively.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Xu: Black is forced to make this move now.||If red were allowed to play C9=7, black would be in trouble. ||I think this move by GM Liu was very good. ||If I played R3+1, he would counter with R8=4, targetting my most powerful attacking piece now.This would be quite troublesome for me as it was the center of my whole attack. ||That is why sacrificing the black horse was a good move, as blackhas the material upperhand now and would be prepared to launch a counter attack anytime now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Xu: As I thought that taking his horse was not very good, so I decided to defend first, and tried to gain pawn material first. I had not thought much about this move, and it was mainly instinctive when I played it.||When GM Liu was pondering on his moves, I saw that he could have played C2+3 and I could not come up with a satisfactory counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]GM Xu: As I was still pondering on what move to make, "BAM" , GM Liu decided to offer a sacrifice. ||LOL, I think he never even considered a more defensive move. ||This move should not have been made. The threat of the elbow horse had not been eliminated and that is why it was not ok. Perhaps GM Liu was already under time pressure and played this move out of instinct. And he is an aggressive player by nature, so it was his tendency to attack first before defending.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]GM Xu: Perhaps GM Liu had thought that there might  be chances of an attack with this move. If you looked at the board right now, black's situation was not bad and had a few more extra pawns and was targeting the bottom ranked elephant...perhaps these gave GM Liu the wrong instinct.||You: Under such tense circumstances, the instincts and feel of the game could affect his ultimate analysis. ||Xu: Playing the game based purel on instinct is very dangerous. The game is very complicated. It would be much better to pick a few major variations and think about each one of them carefully. Unfortunately, time was not on his side and it created quite a predicament for him.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Xu:At this stage in the game, if I captured the pawn (with H5+4), GM Liu would surely have played C3+6 and then maneuver his throat ranked chariot to this side of the board for the kill. It would indeed seem that GM Liu would have his chances in the game. ||That is why, upon further consideration, I decided  not to be bothered with his black cross river pawn and push my pawn across the river first. I think this move created much trouble for him.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Xu: This move by him was very aggressive. It was becoming harder for me to play. And to be honest, I did not know what to do when he made it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]You: What if black chose to play R8+7?||Xu: I would have countered with an exchange offer with R3-6. This endgame would be ok for both. However, it was against GM Liu's character, and once he saw this possibility, he charged his cannon across.||Jim: Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Xu: H6+4 was also possible but GM Liu had more pawns. That is why I decided to capture it first. ||Jim: Please click on the variation to see the moves that GM Xu suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Xu: Black would be in trouble now as I could play H6+7 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]Black resigns.||You: GM Xu makes it so easy explaining this game now. But I am sure that under such complex circumstances, you must have spent quite a bit of brainpower and was exhausted.||Xu: It was not that tiring. This game was quite open and my game was more of a counter of GM Liu's moves. The main factor was that GM Liu played rather quickly and so did I. We did not hold much back. ||I think that black sacrificing the horse was not advisable. And I am still thinking of ways to counter should he have played C2+3 instead of C2=3 instead. I guess I will need to think of it back home and I still do not have a decent solution.||You: Then we thank you, GM Xu. There will be a photo session and a signing session afterward...||Jim: And I need to take my break too...[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_52]Xu: And it would be possible to capture black's chariot. But black would still have the pawn advantage. That is why I decided to simplify things and capture the central pawn first instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_45]Jim: GM Xu's counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_36]Jim: these variations were the ones that GM Xu suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]And GM Xu would have trouble answering![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]GM Xu: And it seems that black was still ok![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]Jim: This was the move that GM Xu Tianhong played against GM Liu Dianzhong in the 2001 1st ever BGN Xiangqi World Championships. The starting moves were a little bit different but this formation was reached. The moves that follow are the actual moves played by the two GMs.||I have managed to find another game played by Master Hao Jichao[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_77]Jim: The moves ended here. GM Xu Tianhong eventually won the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]Jim: this was the game played by Master Hao Jichao  vs Master Niu Baoming in the 2005 National Team Championships.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]Jim: Master Hao eventually won but it was quite a long game over 60 moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]Jim: I searched far and wide but only managed to find the game played by Jiang Chuan vs Chen Fujie. I could not find the other game that GM Xu mentioned. There were no comments in this one, so I just typed the moves for you to judge for yourself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_50]Jim: These were the moves that I could find the game played by GM Jiang Chuan (then master) against Master Chen Fujie. The game ended in a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]Xu: And although it would still be an even game, the game would be more to GM Liu's liking and style and is it now an open fight. That is why I chose NOT to play this variation, hoping to retain more material and have options for play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]
