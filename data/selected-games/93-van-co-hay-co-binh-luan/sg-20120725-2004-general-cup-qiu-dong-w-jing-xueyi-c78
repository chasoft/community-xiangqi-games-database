[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120725 2004 General Cup Qiu Dong W Jing Xueyi C78||ECCO: C78 57 Cannons with 3rd pawn advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 1st 3rd Pawn advancement and right riverbank horse||ECCO:C78 ??????????????????||Jim: Another board that I found on the internet. Very exciting match. Commentary was provided by Master Nie Tiewen||||This was an A league match held in 2004 in the General's Cup. Qiu Dong did not do very well early in the competition, but he performed very well when he went up against Master Jing Xueyi, fully showing his speedy and witful play, and winning the game in style. He won this match to help his team.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Up till this stage, red chooses to adopt a wait and see strategy with this move. ||Please click on the variation below to see commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]In ther 10th Asian Invite, I (Master Nie Tiewn) had played the exact same formation against Vietnam's Zheng Yasheng. I had played A4+5 in that game... ||Please click on the variation below to see the variation played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Perhaps black can also consider playing H2+3. ||Please click on the variation below to see Master Nie'w suggestions[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]As seen from the board, the game has become a sticky one with both sides threatening each other. ||Red chose to exchange his cannon for black horse, tempting black to advance his cannon forward. Red followed up on his game plan by retreating his horse. It was very nice play by red. ||Perhaps black could have played C3=2...||Please click on the variation below to see Master Niew's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Black played this move to prevent red from capturing the elephant (to attempt the smothered cannon checkmate). This is very stubborn play from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Black tries to fortify his center with this move, failing to see the drastic consequences that would result from red's R7+5!||Black should have played C2=3 to defend instead...||Please click on the variation below to see Master Nie's recommendation[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]And red decides to make full use of this opportunity. After careful calculation, red takes the elephant to ensure victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Black is forced to make this move out of desperation. Even if black chose to play C3+5, it would be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Red has gained a free elephant and caused severe imbalance and disruption of Black's defensive formation.||Let us see how red goes for the final kill.?[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]And black resigned after seeing that he was in a hopeless situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]And red would be on the winning end with this move. ||Red now threatens with a kill and capture of the black central chariot.||Red would not be far  away from a win too with this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]And this would provide better defence than the actual game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]!||Master Nie's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]And although black would still be on the receiving end, this would seem to be a better predicament than the actual game played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]Moves suggested by Master Nie[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]And it would be a standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]Moves played in the 10th Asian Invite whereby Vietnam's Zheng Yasheng went up against China's Nie Tiewen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]And it was a relatively even situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]Normally played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]And red can could choose from C5=6, C5=4 and C7+3 and options for the next move. Black is still able to handle red's aggressions for all the variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
