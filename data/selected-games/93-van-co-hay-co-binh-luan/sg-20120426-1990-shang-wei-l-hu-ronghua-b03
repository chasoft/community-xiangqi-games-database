[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120426 1990 Shang Wei L Hu Ronghua B03||ECCO B03 Central Cannon vs Mandarin Duck Cannons||ECCO:B03 ??????||This was a game played in 1990. Red was Master Shang Wei from Liaoning Province, while Black was GM Hu Ronghua.||I chose this game because GM Hu used a rather rare counter: the Mandarin Duck Cannons ???. ||Master Shang Wei is one of the top Xq players from Liaoning Province. He has authored many books, all of very high quality.||GM Hu...needs no introduction.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And this is the basic formation of black's unorthodox defense.||By playing the chariot to protect the cannon, black prepares to move C2-1 and then C2=5/C2=8... to concentrate his chess pieces to one side of the board. ||If played well, black could have a very versatile defense. However, clogging of the pieces to one side of the board could also easily cause black to  be congested and delay the development of the his pieces. ||Although this is a relatively rare opening, it is still used now and then, even in competition. The central cannon must know how to counter or be hit with many flying daggers.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red must play this move or his chariot would be attacked by black's C2=8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]By playing this move, red attempts to prevent the black cannons from moving to the left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And GM Hu does not back down. Instead he counters with this aggressive move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This move shows the versatility of the mandarin duck cannons. The throat rank cannon can attack red's 1st,3rd and 5th file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Attacking the red elephant on the baseline is often one of black's primary aims.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Post game analysis suggests that this was not a good move. C8=5 would have been better...[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And red answers with a not so efficient move...||Post game analysis suggests that this is not a good move either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]This was a risky move. A6+5 would have been a more steady move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And GM Hu goes on the aggressive.||R8+6 would be a less aggressive counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Another very risky move, pushing the game to another climax![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]P7+1 is another alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]In retrospect, this is the move that lose ts the game for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]It is too late for red now. ||Let us enjoy GM Hu's kill...[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]And black resigns[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_60]and black would be better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]This was the suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]And it would be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]
