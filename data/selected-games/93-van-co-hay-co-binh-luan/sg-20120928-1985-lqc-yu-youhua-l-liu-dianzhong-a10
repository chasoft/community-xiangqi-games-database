[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120928 1985 lqc Yu Youhua L Liu Dianzhong A10||||Jim: This game was played back in 1985, in the Liu Quan Xiangqi Masters Invite�???�???????. Future GM vs GM.||Comments were provided by GM Liu Dianzhong himself.||Both GMs are famous for their aggressive styles.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Playing the side horse in response to the elephant opening is rare. I did not want the game to conform to the usual openings.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This was one of the key turning points in the game. By advancing the right cannon to red's pawn rank, this cannon would be able to limit the development of red's left horse. It would prove crucial later on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]In the opening stages, an often used tactic is to sacrfice a pawn to try to delay or slow down the development of the opponent's pieces.?[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Good move!||Red prevented black from playing C7=8 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Another possible option would be P5+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]This move was made to prevent E3-1, thus stalling red's game plans.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]Good move!!!||Jim: Black threatens to go for the  double cannons checkmate and could possible win material with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]This was a bad move on my part.||I should have played C2=8 to make the game short and sweet.[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]And black starts his campaign with a vicious chariot sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment83]Red tries to buy some breathing space with this exchange. It was made out of desperation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment108]And black wins the game.||In this game, the battle was decided in the midgame. Black had made use of his spatial advantage to maneuver his pieces to try to obtain better development.[/DhtmlXQ_comment108]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_74]Another brilliant chariot sacrifice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_78]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_78]And black would still be pounding hard with no signs of relenting. Red would still be not far from a loss![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_66]GM Liu's suggested move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_72]And black would not be able to prevent the red checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_72]
