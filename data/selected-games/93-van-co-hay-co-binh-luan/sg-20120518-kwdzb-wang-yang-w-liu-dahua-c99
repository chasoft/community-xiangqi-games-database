[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120518 kwdzb Wang Yang W Liu Dahua C99||||ECCO C99 59 Cannons vs Screen Horse Defense||ECCO:C99 ???????||||Master Wang Yang, one of the hottest players on the circuit takes on GM Liu Dahua in this very exciting game in 2006. It was the 7th round of the  Kaiwei Real Estate Cup whereby only xq masters or GMs were allowed to compete.||Commentary was provided by Master Zhang Xiaoping ???.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]" This was the 5th ever Kaiwei Real Estate Cup. It was round 7 when Master Wang Yang and GM Liu Dahua met. ||After 5 rounds, the opening has evolved into the Central CAnnon with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement variation. ||By playing the ranked chariot, black opts for one of the older variations, which is seldom seem nowadeays. ||Most players would play E3+5 or C2+4 ...."||Please click on the variations below to see the moves suggested by Master Zhang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]"Red plays the side cannon to prepare for R9=8. It is a correct strategy aimed at black's ranked chariot variation. ||If black played R2+6 now..."||Please click on the variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]"Trying to limit the development of the red horse with this move does not seem to be an effective move in retrospect. C2=7 could be a better alternative..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]"Black could also consider playing C8+4 to form a blockade first before playing this move."[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"Red sacrificed his pawn to gain control of his pawn rank. It is a successful attempt at relieving the stress that black's 3rd file cannon has placed on his left flank. It shows that red has read the game nicely."[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]"Good move!!! With this cross riverbank chariot, red has firmly maintained control of the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]"Black is forced to exchange pawns. If black chose to play P3+1 .... " ||Please click on the variation ....[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]"By retreating the cannon, black prepares to fortify his center. If black chose to play E7+5 .. ." ||Pls click on the variation .[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]"At this stage in the game, black's bottom ranked chariot is now unprotected and his cannon and chariot are being pinned by the red chariot. Black is in deep trouble now..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]"An initial analysis of the game thus far shows that both sides have the chess pieces in a deadlock. By playing E7+5, black prepares to free his bottom ranked chariot with R8=6, thereby slowly chipping away the advantage that red has built up thus far. ||BUT, red seizes a chance to to increase his control of the game with his side cannon! This side cannon would prove to be fatal to black!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]"With this cannon move, red disrupts the linkage between the black horses. Good move!!!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]"This was a controversial move. P3+1 would have been better ... "||Pls click on the variation to understand what GM Zhang had suggested...[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]"If black played C8=9 ... "[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]"Black attempts to decrease the material that red has.But in actual fact, it allowed red a fierce attack! In retrospect, R4-3 to defend the pawn rank would seemed to have been better ! "[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]"If black chose to exchange chariots with R1=7 instead..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"With this move, red attempts to capture black's riverbank chariot with a discovered check of C5+2. This would force black to move his chariot away from the riverbank, thereby freeing red from the pin that black's chariot has applied.||If red chose to attack rapidly with H2+3 ... "||Pls click on the variation below...[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]"Analysis of the game at this stage shows that although red's chess pieces are well placed, black has set up a tight defense. It would seem that Red does not have any weaknesses to target...||But in the actual game played, Master Wang Yang found a tiny weakness in black's defense and exploited it thoroughly! What follows is a very nice kill!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]"And red played his moves correctly. By performing a check first and then retreating his chariot to protect his horse, red has gained material and is now poised for the final kill! "[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment79]"And red played brilliantly to gain material!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment91]"And black resigned!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment91]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_53]"Too rushed..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_62]"And black would still be able to hold his own against red."[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]"And the positioning of the red chariot and horses are supreme! Black would have a hard time trying to defend!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]"And red would control black's pawn rank. Black would still have a hard time in the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_38]Master Zhang's suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]" and although red would still be in the lead, this would still be better than what actually happened in the game. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_38]???NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_47]"And red would be prepared to win the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_29]"And black would not be able to protect his cross river pawn. Red would be total control then!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_29]"Black would still be tons of trouble..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_14]Master Zhang's suggested move[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_18]"and black would have more chances of attack..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_12]"Or black could also play H8+7 for the riverbank horse variation, whereby black would have many chances of wrestling control of the game away from black."[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_11]Or red could also choose to play C8+2 for the riverbank cannon variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_12]"And the game would progress into the bloody variation of the double cross river cannon variation of the screen horse defense."[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_12]
