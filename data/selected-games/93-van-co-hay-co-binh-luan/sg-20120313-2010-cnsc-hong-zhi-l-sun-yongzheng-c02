[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120313 2010 cnsc ||Hong Zhi L Sun Yongzheng||ECCO C02 Central Cannon with 7th Filed Horse vs Screen Horse Defense||ECCO:C02 ?????????||This match was played in Round 5 of the 2010 Chinese National Singles Competition.||GM Hong Zhi squares off against Master Sun Yongzheng (who would make GM in 2011 by winning the same tournament).||Master Sun was on a roll had had been having a high winning percentage prior to this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And the opening formation is basically defined.||Red uses the Central Cannon with 7th Filed Horse while Black counters with the Screen Horse Defense.||According to my annotated book, GM Lv Qin and GM Hong Zhi had been studying this opening ferociously in preparation for the Asean games.||They had created many flying daggers...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Master Sun is very familiar with pushing the cannon forward for this opening variation and is one of his "secret" weapons.||Master Sun decides to play something familiar against the young GM. It is also an opening that he has studied ferouciously.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is a must make move. All the moves that red had played up till this stage were to prepare for this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Perhaps GM Hong had not anticipated this move. ||After much consideration he opts for this aggressive move, exchanging his chariot for black's cannon and horse.||The following variations were postulations suggested by Master Huang Hailin and GM Zhao Xinxin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]It is only move 12 and both sides are strangling each other.||Master Sun decides to be even more aggressive and threatening than GM Hong in this battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]This moves exemplifies the the fiery style of play of GM Hong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Before this move, it was still a fierce battle with neither side having the significant upperhand.||Post-game analysis blames this H4+5 move as the reason for red's downfall.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Black sees his chance and begins his campain mercilessly...||With this move, the left red chariot is functionless, and black gets to attack.||At this point in the game, it is obvious that if red had played C3-1 on move 14, that cannon on the third file would have been put to good use and black would not have been able to attack so mercilessly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Master Sun does not forget to defend and play C2+1 now or GM Hong would have a kill in waiting with H5+7.||With this move, black has prevented any surprises that red might spring and is now ready to for the final blow.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Or R2=5 would checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]Or red could still mount a last ditch attempt with R4+8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]And black gains back the lost material.||All black has to do now is to prevent a do-or-die attempt from red...[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]And GM Hong Zhi resigned.||The following moves explain why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]Or R8+7 would win with the Face-to-face laughing checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]And red would be unable to the double chariot checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment76]mate[/DhtmlXQ_comment76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_71]Even if GM Hong defended with this move, the loss in material would be unsurmountable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_40]This was added for beginners to see why K6+1 was played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_43]Tiger Silhouette. Red would still have a chance of a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]And if both sides do not change, it would be a draw.||However, there was a new rule in the 2010 competition. Should red both sides repeat moves before move 20, red must change his moves and red is not allowed to offer a draw. Perhaps GM Hong was wary of this rule.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_33]And both sides would still be in deadlock![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]This might have been a better move, and is definitely more versatile that H5+4. Red can wait one move and see what atack black is attempting and then defend accordingly.||This move also allows red to play C3=9 to give his chariot a root and also to place pressure on black's right flank should the black cannon become a real pain. An extra pawn would be gained also.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]A move necessary for survival.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]Great move! You will see why.||Black is not in a hurry to capture the dead red chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_36]And black is guaranteed to gain material after this exchange.||According the Masters Huang and GM Zhao, there are  still many many variations to this opening but it is evident that Master Sun had prepared well.||GM Hong is now in deep trouble... and that is why he opted to go on the attack with H7+5 on move 9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]!!! And black would be superior in all aspects.||Black can threaten with a checkmate with R2=3![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]No can do!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]And Black would be down material wise![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]This would not be a wise move now as red has been eyeing the center for a long time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_21]and red would then play R9=8 and black would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]and red would have lost his initiative to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_16]This was the move that Master Sun played in a match not too long ago against Heilongjiang's Master Nie Tiewen in the 4th Yang Guanlin Cup.||Master Sun lost that match and the following moves were the ones that were played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_29]After exchaning one chariot for one horse and one cannon, red had the advantage! Master Nie Tiewen eventually lost that game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_29]
