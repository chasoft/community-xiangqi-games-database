[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121224 2004 Jing XueYi W Zhang ShenHong C23||????????????||||ECCO:C23 ???????????????||ECCO:C23 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th filed horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double Headed Snake Pawn Formation ||||Jim: Another file from the internet, which happens to use the opening that GM Liu DianZhong had showed in my recent uploads during the last two weeks. Commentary was provided by GM Wang JiaLiang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]This was a very exciting match from the fifth round of the General's Cup ??? in 2004. ||Black chooses to advance the pawn 7th file pawn to prevent red from moving P3+1, such that the opening would never become the P3+1 variations. It would also allow black to play a variation that he was more familiar with.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]If red chose to play P7+1 now, it would become another different variation. Black would then choose to play C8=9 or H8+7 for very complex variations and sub-variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And the basic opening for both sides is basically defined.||Red has chosen the Central Cannon with filed and ranked chariots for attack while black has chosen to counter with the screen horse defense with the double headed snake pawn formation.||Red's opening has the advantage of rapidly developed chariots that would apply much pressure on black's formation.||Black on the other hand would have a stable and solid defense waiting, and would wait patiently for his chances to launch a counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]P7+1 is sometimes played but black would be able to escape unscathed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]As seen for the board, this formation had appeared quite a few times in the 1990's. But statiscal evidence has weighed the case against black, as black would seem to lack a forceful counter, and this variation slowly went out of fashion. After then 90's, it was seen only once in a while. ||Black has tried to play H7+6, and once of the most  notable games was in the 2001 team championships whereby GM Tao HanMing took on GM Zhao GuoRong.||Jim: pls click on the variation below. ||ps, Zhao is Wang's protege. And GM Tao eventually rendered his services to Wang's HeiLongJiang team where he and Zhao work together now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]A not very flexible move!||With this move, Black intendes to capture the red chariot with H8-6 on the next move.||Black should have played A4+5 for this move.||Jim: Pls click on the variation on black's 11th move to understand what GM Wang meant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red does not not fear black's C2=3 and instead chooses to advance his horse forward for attack.||This was Master Jing's tactic of "drawing the snake out of the hole"??????. ||Jim: Damn, how do I translate this one...it simply meant that Master Jing had anticipated what would happen and deliberate made this move to force black to reveal his intentions and also a weakness in his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black is forced to swallow red's sacrifice unwillingly.||That is because all of black's chess pieces were malpositioned and were not very movable.||That was why he decided to gain material first and adopt a wait and see attitude.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And red gains back lost material with this move.||As black's cannon is now unable to apply pressure on red's bottom ranked elephant, the entire black defense and formation would seem weak, especially on black's right flank.||Red on the other hand would have managed to concentrate his forces on black's right flank and is ready to lauanch his attack. ||Jim: Red has drawn black's snake (the cannon) out of the hole...[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Black cannot play C6-1 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]Black has no other alternative to resolve red's attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]And the endgame has simplified into 1r1c1p2a2e sw 1r2a2e endgame for red.||The moves that follow are just black's futile attempts at a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment133]And red makes use of the poor position of black's chariot, and delivers a brilliant kill.||Black is sure to lose the chariot now and that was why he resigned.||Jim: I have added a few more moves to show beginners why the black chariot is lost.[/DhtmlXQ_comment133]
[DhtmlXQ_comment134]Or R2=6 would checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment134]
[DhtmlXQ_comment141]And red would easily win now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_56]Bad move![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_57]![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]And red has gained material and is ready for the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_63]And red would be sure to win![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_51]![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]And black would be sure to lose advisor(s) and elephant(s). Red would be not far away from victory.||Jim: For beginners, I added a few more moves of my own to show what the GM meant...||Red is poised to checkmate with R6+1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_63]And red would be ready to play R5+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_61]And red has destroyed black's defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_54]Cannot play this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_57]And red would be sure to win now![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]Jim: I added this variation to explain what GM Wang meant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]And this was what black would had hoped, to be able to have a versatile formation ready.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_18]More commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_19]These were the moves played in the 2001 team championships when Tao HanMing took on Zhao GuoRong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_32]![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_44]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]And that game eventually ended in a draw after a fierce battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]Another possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]And black would still be able to counter whatever red throws at him.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_22]
