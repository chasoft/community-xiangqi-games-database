[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120503 1976 competition Liu Dahua W Hu Ronghua D26||ECCO D26 Same Direction Cannons: Filed Chariot vs Ranked Chariot||||This was another file I found during my break. It was annotated by GM Liu himself. GM Liu had not become national champion, and Xq was just starting to become popular again after the Cultural Revolution in the 70's, whereby Xq was banned. ||GM Liu and GM Hu both do not need introduction. Both are the measuring yardsticks whereby others are compared to. They are living greats. ||Below is the commentary by GM Liu himself: ||"In this friendly , between Guangdong, Shanghai, Beijing and Hubei, I went up against Hu Ronghua. It was the third time we met. I played well duing this encounter and it was the first time I actually won against Hu."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]For beginners, this is the basic formation of the Same Direction Cannons: Filed chariot vs Ranked chariot variation. ||It is one of the oldest, if not the oldest openings in the history of Xiangqi.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]"At that time, when playing the same direction cannons in this proper horse vs ranked horse variation, black would often choose to play H2+3 to fortify the center. GM Hu did not conform and played a new variation of the side horse. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]"After black had played the side horse, black's center would become relatively weakened. H3+4 to attack the center is another possible variation to gain the central pawn. It might have also been better than this side cannon move of mine."[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]"Black plays the cross river chariot, which effectively restricts the development of the red chess pieces. At this stage, black can be satisfied with the outcome of his opening. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]" Black edges the cannon for an immediate chariot exchange offer. Black may have lost tempo in terms of the moves made, but his formation is well balanced. Coupled with the fact that the black cannon is targeting red's 7th file and the horse, this balance in formation more than makes up for the loss in the number of effective moves made. In fact, other than this move, there seems to be no other better move."[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]" This was a must make move. Black threatens to push P3+1. The best way to defend would be to readjust Red's formation."[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]"After red had moved the central cannon away, red's 7th file is now protected and no more a worry to red. Black correctly changes his plans and chose to attack the center.||At this stage, red sacrificed his pawn on the 3rd file for a head on confrontation with the black chariot, in order to protect the center. This was a very target oriented move. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]"Pushing the chariot forward at this stage was a little bit forced for black."[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]" By sacrificing the chariot for a two horse exchange, red tries to simplify things and keep a the advantage he still has. Another option would be to play C5=8."[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]"Black traverses the chariot to try to capture the  cannon. Maybe Black had underestimated the various tactics that red could employ by sacrificing the two elephants! This was the move mainly responsible for black's eventual demise. If Black had played C5-3, there would be many chances for forcing a draw. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]"Red threatens to attack the center with C9=5 or even C4=5. To resolve this threat, black was forced reluctantly to return the cannon to where it was to defend..."||||Please click on the variation to see what happened if black chose to play C2-2 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]"During the past few moves, Red has played the horses brilliantly, creating much trouble for black. Black is forced to play E3+1 to block the horse. If black did not make this move, Red's H9+8 would create even more trouble for black."[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]"Even if black played A4-5, it would be hard to escape a loss. "||||Please click on the variation to understand the moves that GM Liu suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]" Another alternative would be to play R6-6..."||||Please click on the variation to see what would happen if black played R6-6 instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment109]"After a hard fought 3 hour battle, the time limit was up when black played P7+1 and it now overtime. As red's advantage was obvious, black resigned.||The following moves were what I had in mind ..." ||||There was some recording mistakes in the moves and all questionable moves were omitted...[/DhtmlXQ_comment109]
[DhtmlXQ_comment125]"And all that black could do was to watch red march the pawn on the 9th file forward for the final kill..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment125]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_97]"And red would play H3+4 on the next move for the pin and the win."[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_97]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_77]There was a mistake in the recording of the moves after this one ( I think some moves have been omitted), but red would eventually be able to play H3+1 to have the overwhelming material and positional advantage ."[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_71]"And red would be much better!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_55]"And red would have a very aggressive attack whereby black would have had a hard time resolving..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_55]"... and red would gain material."[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]"Black could have played this move for a more peaceful game..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]"And the game would become drawish..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]
