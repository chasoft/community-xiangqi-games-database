[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130125 2007cnsc Huang HaiLin L Sun YongZheng E37||ECCO:E37 ???????????????||ECCO:E37 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon Variation vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation.||Jim: In case you have not seen the boards by GM Liu on this opening, ECCO defines P3+1 by default but most players play P7+1, hence there would discrepancies in the position of the elephant moved. This was a board from the internet.||Unfortunately, the commentator was not known, but seems to be of at least Master level. This was played in the National Singles Championships in 2007.||||Commentary:||Master Huang HaiLin is one of the key members of the GuangDong team and was crucial in helping the GuangDong team win the team championships.||Master Sun YongZheng ( Sun became GM in 2012) is one of the stronger players of his generation, and was very well placed in the ranking competition.||Both competitors are about the same age and together with Hong Zhi and Nie Tiewen, are collectively known as the Four Small Dragons. ||Let us enjoy their battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Playing the side orse first has been very popular this year (2007). ||H2+3 is another commonly used variation.||Black would counter with P3+1 or R9+1 and the basic formation of Angel's Pawn vs Thundering Defense with Right elephant would be set.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Commonly played counter. ||P7+1 and H8+7 are other commonly played variations, and each would have their different ways of attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This is to prevent the black chariot from moving to the other flank.||Another commonly played variation would be H2+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]P5+1 is one of the newer variations this year. I was the first to have played it.||In the past, C5-2 was played and Master Jin Song was well known for this variation.||Jim: Still do not know who the commentator was!!!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is less commonly played but nevertheless still a viable move.||In the past R9=8 was played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And black attacks with a clear target in mind.||This would force red to play P3+1. ||The game would now evolve around red's central pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]If red played P3+1, black would counter with C8+4. ||If red tried P5+1 now, black could counter with C8=1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Red's central pawn has been the issue for the past few moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]This would seem to be a little bit rash.||Perhaps C8+3 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]At this point in the game, red has lost his advantage by default.||Black;s opening campaign can be deemed a success.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Red tries to apply pressure on black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]R3=2 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]It would seem that red had underestimated the potential of black's attack.||Red should have played C8-2, and although red would still be lagging behind, at least he would not lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And black starts his plan to corner and capture the red cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Since the red cannon's chances of making it are slim, perhaps a better move would be to play C9=4...[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Zwischenburg!||Instead of capturing the cannon, black took his time to force the pesky red horse to an unfavorable position before capturing the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]And red is still forced to sacrifice the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]Perhaps a more proactive move would be H5+4 as playing H5-7 would seem a little bit passive. ||H5+4 would also allow black to protect black's pawn on the first file indirectly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68] At this stage in the game, although red is one cannon down, he has made up for it from other places ( eg the cross river pawn and better positioning).There would still be a chance for a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment72]And black decides to break red's linked horses in order to pry open red's defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]This move did not do much. And red has given up control of black's pawn rank.||Perhaos R4-2 to patrol the river would be better as red could try to exchange pawns. ||The chances for a draw would be greater.[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]Perhaps Red was under time pressure, as the past few moves were made without much purpose.||Black on the other hand, has freed his black cannon from the bottom rank.||This would greatly increase the difficulty of black trying to force a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment86]It is obvious that black CANNOT capture the red pawn, or red would play H1+3![/DhtmlXQ_comment86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]And black has managed to adjust his formation and is now ready to launch an attack of his own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment104]And black has managed to simplify the endgame into one where he has the material advantage. ||A win is imminent now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment104]
[DhtmlXQ_comment134]And red resigned.||In retrospect, red had made a nonchalant move and had to pay dearly. In the midgame, other weak moves cost him the game.||In the fight of the small dragons, Sun YongZheng had the final victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment134]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_98]And red would have a hard time holding on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_98]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_86]Jim: I added this variation with a few moves of my own to show why the pawn is poisoned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_91]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_91]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_93]And red would be sure to win now![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_93]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_75]And red could consider playing H7+6 to exchange for the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_64]In this way, it would be harder for black to try to draw the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]And although the red cannon is sacrificed, at least the red horse would be able to obtain a favourable position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_37]And red would have gotten his chess pieces out, and also prevented black from cornering his cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_28]Black would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_23]The position of the cannon here would seem to be better than the actual game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]And after the exchange of cannons, both sides would be roughly equivalent.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_16]And black can be very satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_20]And black would continue to attack.||Red would not want this to happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_18]And although the game would be tied up, black would still have a game going on. ||Black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_13]And black would conunter with R1=2 or R6+3.||An actual game played with variation R6+3 is shown here.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_25]And it would be a tangled game but red would still hold on to the lead.||This was the game that was played this year when GM Wang Bin took on GM Xu YinChuan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_17]Another commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_17]
