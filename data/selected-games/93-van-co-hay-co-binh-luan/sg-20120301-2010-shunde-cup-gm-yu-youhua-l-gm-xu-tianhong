[DhtmlXQ_comment0]2010 Shunde Cup||???????????????||This was played on 2012-02-17. ||Taking red was 2002 National Champion Yu Youhua.||Black was 1989 National Champion Xu Tianhong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]This move allows red to speed the development of his left flank and is one of the newer variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black chooses to play it safe.||There is much pressure on black's left flank, therefore, by exchanging the chariots, black relieves the stress that red has applied.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]For this opening, one of the current trends is to play this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And black is still able to hold his own![/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And red would have good prospects and control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Post game analysis suggests that H8-6 would be a more versatile move for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Red seems to have been rash to play this move.||C8+1 seems to be a better choice! The game would still be relatively even. The central pawn could prove itself to be meance once it crosses the river.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Red tries to go for the kill with this move. He does not see danger of this move.||However, post-game analysis suggests that red play C5-2 and it would still be a very even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]And red resigns!||Black would gain one major piece and it would not be long before the red pawns are killed and black charges his pawns across the river.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And in a game with no chariots, having an extra major piece is often enough![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]mate![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]And red would be much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]and the red would gain material!||The black horse cannot move or there would be a double toast checkmate by red![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]And black is still able to hold his own![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_49]And red would be so much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And although red has an additional central pawn, the game has been simplified and is basically drawish in nature.||Red would not want that![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_33]And red would still have the initiative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]and it would be a completely different attacking and defensive game for both sides![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
