[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120229 2010 jjls Liu Dahua W Hao Jichao||C93 58 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement||ECCO:C93 ???????????||"Old" GM Liu Dahua, born in 1950, has been a force to reckon with for the past 40+ years. He was the man who stopped GM Hu Ronghua's 10 time winning streak. GM Liu was also consecutive National Champion in 1980,1981. Also known as the Oriental Computer, he set the record for 1 vs 19 in a blindfold Xq match in 1995. This record was only recently broken by GM Jiang Chuan (see bio and facts). GM Liu is still very active in the Xiangqi world in China and has maintained decent rankings consitently. He still wins a lot of tournaments. ||Master Hao Jichao, is another Xq star on the rise. Born in 1985 and a native of Harbin City, he has slowly worked his way up the ladder, making Master by coming in at 17th place in the 2009 Chinese National Singles Competition.||I have chosen this game because it was one of the most exciting games that I have seen in the past month. Master Hao mounts a very fierce attack and even nearly wins, before making a fatal mistage. And GM Liu seized the opportunity to win. Very very exciting. ||For those new to ECCO, ECCO does not take into consideration the which side the first move is made, so although GM Liu plays C8=5, it is still recognized by ECCO as C2=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Master Hao plays the pawn first so that red cannot play Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]By playing the ranked chariot, black opts for a very aggressive counter.||Other commonly played variation include P9+1 and E3+5[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]There is also a R1+1 variation for red. Click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Correct move for black.||It is not advisable to play C7+6 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]R2=4 is another suggested move![/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]At this stage, both sides are entangled but red still holds the slight lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]And a heart stopping battle begins!||Master Hao draws first blood with this chariot exchange![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]GM Liu wants to win it bad, and makes the first mistake. By capturing the elephant, he actually helps Master Hao from moving his king out to a position where he is safe.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]And GM Liu uses up two moves with this chariot to try to capture the black horse.||Red's left flank is empty...and black draws blood again...[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]Post game analysis suggests that red can play R3+5  and it would seem that he would have more chances ![/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment59]To get rid of the threat the horse poses, red has used 3 chariot and one cannon moves, while at this time, black has been mounting his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment72]Red is faced with a do or die situation. A slight mistake and black would win![/DhtmlXQ_comment72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]Correct move. ||Post game analysis indicates that if the central pawn were not captured,black would be unable to win the game.||Unfortunately, my manual does not show why... LOL[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment90]Instead of playing this move, and allowing red a breather, it was suggested that black play C1=4 instead! Black would still have the better prospects.[/DhtmlXQ_comment90]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]BLUNDER!!!||Post game analysis suggests that this is the beginning of the end for black.||Black fears the red horse from crossing the river...[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]FATAL BLUNDER!||Post game analysis suggests that this is the move that cost black the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment99]Black resigns!||The comment was Master Hao played a good first half, but made a fatal mistake at the end...||For beginners...click on to understand why black resigned...[/DhtmlXQ_comment99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment105]and red would torture black to death...[/DhtmlXQ_comment105]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_105]and red would win eventually. ||he would capture the black pawn and charge his pawn for the win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_105]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_101]and red captures the chariot with the discovered check.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_101]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_94]suggested move...||black attempts a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_100]And although black is still on the receiving end, he could still hang on for a fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_92]suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_94]And black would still live to fight another day![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]Another move suggested![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_34]And all of black's pieces have much room to maneuver. The game could be anybody's for the taking![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_29]And after this exchange, it is clear that red has the superior upperhand![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]And black does well in this variation![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_35]And red would be better off!!!||Black has charged too deeply without backup.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]This is another variation in this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_37]and red would still be slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_15]Another commonly played variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_25]There seemed to be a typing error in my manual...but anyway, further play would show that red has the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_13]Another commonly played variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_35]And red would be much better off, both material wise and formation wise.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_35]
