[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121008 2004 cnsc Zhang Shenhong L Xu Yinchuan C42||ECCO C42 Central Cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Varation||ECCO:C42 ?????????????????||||Jim: Another interesting game with colorful comments found on the internet. ||Comments were provided by Master Liang Wenbing (aka the gold medallist coach ????) and Liang Jianfeng. Master Liang Wenbing's books and analysis have always been a good read as they are very constructive comments.||The opening used in this board is similar to the opening that I had uploaded a few days ago. ||||L&L:||Master Zhang Shenhong has improved much after two years in the A league. According to other Xiangqi Masters, since Master Zhang was admitted into the Beijing team, his Xiangqi kungfu improved by one move and his experience and depth of the game had increased by 2 moves. (Jim: heck, the original word they used was ?, that is, how many moves you are ahead of your opponent. Need experts to help me translate this one!!!)||This game was played in the last round of the 2004 National Singles Championships. Prior to this match, Master Zhang had accumulated half a point more than GM Xu. If Master Zhang won or drew the game, he would be able to be promoted to the Triple A (??)league. GM Xu had to win to do so. ||It was a do or die situation for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Whenever an important match arose, Master Zhang would more often than not use his Central Cannon.||After making this move, he strategically asked GM Xu if he wanted a draw.||It was not know if GM Xu heard or missed the comment, he did not answer and continued with the game. ||Jim: Whew, a psychic attack on the first move! WOW.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]After making this move, Master Zhang once again asked GM Xu if he wanted to draw the game.||This time round, GM Xu replied calmly :" Let us play a few more moves before coming to a decision!"||It looked like the GM was prepared for a fight![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Under most circumstances, when Red plays H8+7, it would seem that he preferred a slower paced game so that a draw would be more likely. ||However, Master Zhang had more in his mind than just a simple plan with H8+7. ||In the General's Cup ??? ( A league competition), Master Zhang had used this variation to fool Master Wang Yang and GM Hu Ronghua. In this very same comeptieion (National Singles), Master Zhag had also obtained favourable results against GM Liu Dahua.||That was why when Master Zhang tried to repeat his success with H8+7 , GM Xu became cautious and decided to play R1+1. ||Jim: still waters run deep... ||Please click on the variation below to see what the common variations would be.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Moving the central cannon away first appeared in the late 1980's. It was an unorthodox variation. The more commonly played move is P3+1 for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And by advancing the central pawn, black starts his counter![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]GM Xu sacrificed his pawn to try to disrupt Red's defense on the pawn rank. This was a very good order of the way that black plays his moves![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red is forced to open up his pawn rank. It would be even worse for red if he allowed the black central pawn to charge forward.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Red shows his aggressions by advancing his chariot to try to capture black's elephant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Perhaps Master Zhang was slightly infuriated with GM Xu's decline for a draw. He decides to it the game a all he has!||Jim: Damn, I love the comments! LOL. The moves that go on from here are bloody and not for the weak of heart.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]After much consideration, GM Xu decided NOT to take the central pawn but attempt for the elbow horse instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]As seen from figure 1, Red's P5+1 was very interesting. Red tempts black to play H6-5 again. It would seem a waste if black does not play H6-5!||And how would black react to such a temptation?||Jim: The tactic of temptation (??)...[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]After much considersation, GM Xu decides to follow through with this elbow horse intentions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Brilliant!!!!!||GM Xu had played the past few moves without hesistation, proving that he had anticipated that the game would proceed to such a scenario when he played H6+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]Sacrficing the horse was part of the GM's plans![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]The treacherous conditions of this game drew many onlookers. There were looks of disbelief on many of the faces. ||Many were thinking why hadn't GM Xu (or ?? as the fondly called him) simply played C6-2 for the kill? Had he not seen this variation? ||NOPE!!!!! Of course NOT!!!!!||||Jim: Please click on the variation below to understand Master Liang's analysis.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]After making this move, perhaps Master Zhang had thought that the worst was over.||He took of his jacket, and left the board to buy some refreshments.||Perhaps this move was also part of his plans to add pressure on GM Xu.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Good move to pile on the pressure![/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]This was a not very obvious soft move. R9=7 would have been better for added defense. ||Jim: Perhaps his refreshments or drink did something to him! Sorry, could not resist adding that...[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And black tries for more gains in this complicated scenario![/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]Red cannot play H8+6 now!||Jim: Pls click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]Why does black NOT play R4+2 for the kill?||That is because...||Jim: Pls click on the variation below to understand why. Red would win instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]Under such complicated and treacherous conditions, Master Zhang shows his valour by choosing the do-or die variation!||||Jim: Please click on the variation below to understand how complicated the situation is![/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]As seen from the board, Master Zhang tries to return an elbow horse of his own, pushing the game to its climax. ||The tense situation drew more spectators so much so that even Master Wang Xiaohua was so engrossed in this game that he forgot that he had his own game was still going on. ||The charged atmosphere was felt by all. ||GM Xu frowned and his wrinkles could be seen.||What was he thinking about?[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]Traversing the cannon not only to resolve red's counter but also to gain the bottom ranked elephant! ||Brilliant![/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]It would seem that it was smooth sailing for black from here on. The loss of the two red elephants seemed to weigh much in Black's favor, but the game was far from over! There were still many hidden dangers for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]Black does not forget to defend this important rank! This showed GM Xu's sense of danger and experience.[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]Because red did not have any more ammunition to continue his attack and he had trouble trying to organize one with the current of forces on the board, so red decides to retreat his chariot and concentrate on defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment76]The position of red's horse was so good that it had become a pain for black.||Black had to remove this pain before he could concentrate fully on his attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]Another example of Kungfu chess! Black does not forget to defend![/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment83]Whey doesn't red play R8=7 to gain an extra elephant first?||That is because ...||Jim: Pls click on the variation below to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment86]Although victory is not far away, GM Xu does not take his chances!||Jim: I have added a few variations to try to explain why C7-1 would not result in a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]And black's chariot mercilessly removes the advisors, leaving the red king to the mercy of the black troops!||Black is not far from a win now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment97]And red is forced to sacrifice his chariot for the red hrose or it would be short kill for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment97]
[DhtmlXQ_comment104]And black won the game after red resigned.||Jim: Whew...Lesson to be learnt from this game: Think twice about leaving your game for refreshments?![/DhtmlXQ_comment104]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_86]Jim: I have added this variation to show why there is no immediate kill with this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_87]This would be possible if the black king controlled the central file as in the previous sub variation that I had added.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_88]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_88]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_87]But there would be no kill that I can see off if red defends this way.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_91]And the game would be far from over.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_91]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_86]And black would win easily!||Jim: I have added a few moves to help the beginner understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_86]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_87]Say red plays this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_92]checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_90]checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_90]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_88]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_88]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_78]Why this is not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_79]And once this chariot is able to take part in red's endeavors, black would have a hard time controlling the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_61]Not good.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_63]Red's first option:[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_64]!||Jim: Oh my GOD!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_66]And black would be sure to gain back material and would not be far from victory!!!||Jim: I have added a few more moves for the beginner to understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_70]checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_72]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_70]And black would play R7+5 or R7+6 for the kill depending on how black responded.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_63]Red's second option:[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_68]And black would have the material advantage but red would have a slight attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_60]no good![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_61]![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_65]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_57]Why this is not feasible![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_60]Black would be sure to gain material and the game would be over!||Jim: Black is still eyeing for red's bottom ranked chariot with this move!||I have added some simple variations for the beginner to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_61]no can do.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_62]And black would simply checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_65]Red cannot move the horse away from this file!||At this stage, black's additional chariot on the board would be too powerful for red to handle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_70]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_70]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment15_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_58]And red would still have hope of a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_56]And red would still be able to hold fort.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_45]L&L: If red tried this...[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_46]And red's game would simply crumble to pieces.||Jim: For beginners, this is a fork by the black horse. Once the pawn is captured the horse can charge forward to assist in the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_36]If GM Xu did decide to take the central pawn...[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_39]And it would be an all out fistfight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20_31]Not advisable to play this move now![/DhtmlXQ_comment20_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20_34]And black would have a vicious attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21_14]L&L: commonly played variation...||Jim: Please check out the opening section on xqinenglish.com under GM Liu's introduction to this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21_17]And the game would be led into variations whereby  Master Zhang was very familiar and well versed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21_17]
