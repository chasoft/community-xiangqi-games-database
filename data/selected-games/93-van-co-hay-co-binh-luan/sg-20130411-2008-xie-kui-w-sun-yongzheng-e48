[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130411 2008 Xie Kui W Sun YongZheng E48||||ECCO:E48 ??????????||ECCO:E48 Pawn with Thundering Defense Variation vs Pawn with Left Central Cannon Variation.||||Jim: This game was played in 2008. It was the "?????" held in SiChuan with a prize money of 60k Yuen. GM Hong Zhi was the champion. 2nd-5th place were GM Zhao XinXin, Master Xu Chao, Master Xie Kui, GM Chen LiChun (female GM who beat male GM Jin Bo in the last round to secure the win!) respectively.||Commentary was by GM Jiang Chuan and Master Liu Jun (female). It is from one of my books.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]The Angel's Pawn is also one of Master Xie's much feared openings.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]In the 80's, playing the right cannon was quite often used. Although lesser in number than the left cannon variation, it has received much study in the 90's and many new lethal variations were found, breathing life into this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]E3+5/E7+5 are also commonly played variations. Playing the elephants would be based on the traditional left elephant variation for black when the Angel's Pawn squares off against the Thundering defense.||This is to prevent black from H8+7 and would increase the defensive capabilities of red.||Jim: In this example, red chose H8+7 instead of playing the elephants.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]This is a more proactive choice from red.||For more stoic or less aggressive players, E3+5 is  an option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]It would seem that E3+5 was a natural move to make but black would have H3-1 as a counter and red's left cannon blockade would be dysfunctional.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Tightly knit move!||This would discourage red from H2+3. If red were allowed to make that move, and develop his right flank, black would be in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And black chose a seldom played move.||R9=8 is usually played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]A6+5 is definitely not one of red's plans![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]In the past few moves, red had forsaken his center to give black a central cannon.||Instead, red chooses to form a blockade with the two pawn ranked cannons while also allowing his horse (H2+3) to join in the action.||It would be roughly equal now for both and there are immediate concerns to address.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Although the red horse has attacked the black horse, red has not addressed his biggest problem: the black central cannon.||Black, on the other hand, has defended well, and is now prepared to launch a counter offensive with C8+2.||Black has seized control of the game now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Red knew that black was now prepared to play C8+2 followed by R2=4. Once the right black chariot is free, red would be in deep trouble.||That is why he thought that with this move, he would obtain a root and hope to simplify things.||But in reality, this would be a loss of material instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]GOOD MOVE!||This was completely unexpected by red![/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And this is perhaps the most stubborn play that red can come up with, despite the loss in material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And black tries to further his initiative with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]R4=5 is not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Red hoped to simplify things with C3-1 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]After red had lost material, black had attacked very precisely and had slowly increased his advantage. Things were looking rosy for black now.||Red's pawn advancement was the most stubborn play that he could come up with.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]C5=3 would have been more ideal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]And the winds blew in the other way now for red.||With the advancement of the pawn to the elephant's eye, black's advantage had been slowly negated bit by bit.||Professional XiangQi players should always have the courage to face up to adversity.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]Black tries to readjust his defensive formation to  diminish the threat posed by red's throat ranked pawn with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment71]And red did not chose to play C3-9 to defend. Instead, he shows his courage to take risks with this move and sounds the horn for attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]As can be seen, although black had the upper hand, red did not conceded and showed his grit and tenacity by charging his pawn forward. ||This caused some hesitation to black. R8+6 would not ensure a clear victory.||However, if black chose to defend now, he would have surrendered the initiative of the game to red.||Red on the other hand was not prepared to use his pawn to exchange for two of black's elephants, thereby evening the odds.[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]And this would have been red's best play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]C1=4 would result in a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment87]Red showed his cunning by moving his pawn to the 2nd file. This would allow him to eliminate the black pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment87]
[DhtmlXQ_comment88]Retreating the king was to protect the advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment88]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]Black was still stung over his loss and made this move without a clear mind.||C1=9 would have been better as it would allow black to exchange material and simplify the game such that a draw was possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment98]C1=6 would have been more stubborn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment98]
[DhtmlXQ_comment99]C1-1 would have been an even better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment106]After the exchange in material, black was still unable to shake off red's pin.||Black would now have a very hard time defending.[/DhtmlXQ_comment106]
[DhtmlXQ_comment109]And red has successfully simplified the endgame to that of a sure-win situation.||Red would go on to win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment109]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_109]And red would have had an easier path to success.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_109]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_88]Or black could also choose H2+4.||Black would given a chance back into the game and it could still be anybody's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_88]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_91]And it would be a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_91]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_76]And in the ensuing attack, black would not be able to ensure a marked advantage going into the last stages of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_76]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_60]And black would have simplified the endgame to his advantage. It would basically be a sure win for black as 1r1h1p sw 1r2p.||However, although this is a sure-win situation, time constraints, the number of natural moves (Jim: Chinese CXA rule) and many other factors would often allow the 1r2p side to force a draw in actual play.||This is also what black had been wary of.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_56]And black would have the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_50]And black would have both material and positional advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_57]And black would still have a long way to go to obtain victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_19]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_12]And Red's left cannon blockade would become dysfunctional.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]And black would have an easy time in the ensuing game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_20]Jim: And black would still be much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_18]And the prospects look good for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment13_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_20]And it would be standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_20]
