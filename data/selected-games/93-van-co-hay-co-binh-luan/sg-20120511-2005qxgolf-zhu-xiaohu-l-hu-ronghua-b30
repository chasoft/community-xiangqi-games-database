[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120511 2005qxgolf Zhu Xiaohu L Hu Ronghua B30||ECCO B30 Central Cannon vs Sandwiched Horse Defence with Deferred Left Proper Horse.||ECCO:B30 ??????????||||GM Hu is famous for his Sandwiched horse opening as a central cannon counter. I found this board recently. Let us see how the Sah master does it!||Master Zhu Xiaohu is one of the up and rising starts in Xiangqi, having achieved nice results in the first decade of the 21st century. He has beaten many GMs in his career. More is expected of this relatively young Master. ||Comments were provided by Master Li Xuesong and given in quotation marks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Jim : This is an interesting variation. Never seen it. I had published a game recently whereby GM Hu played the Mandarin Duck Cannons instead of C8=6 on the previous move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]" This was one of the more exciting games in the 4th round of the 2005 Qixin Golf Xiangqi Championship 2005?“??????”????????. Red used the Central Cannon while Black countered with the Sandwiched Horses. The young Master Zhu shows his aggression by playing R2+8 to impede the development of black's left flank.||Moving A4+5 to chase that pesky red chariot away is a must for red, and is also one of the more experienced ways of dealing with this variation. As Master Zhu had shown his intentions, GM Hu plays this less common variation instead of facing Master Hu head to head early on."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]" As can be seen in this game, GM Hu decides to sacrifice his central pawn to develop his major pieces. This is great play from the GM... ||If black had played H2+3 instinctively, black would be trouble instead! "||Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]"In retrospect, this moves seemed to have been repetitive, losing red some momentum. ||R2=5 would have been better ... "||Please click on the variation below to understand why ![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]"Red should have played R5=7 to gain another pawn. Black would still have a hard time looking for decisive counter..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]"Another inefficient move, giving Black a target to attack as black could now play C6+6 to block the elephant's eye and concentrate his forces on red's empty right flank. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]"As shown in this board, GM Hu shows his keen observation and understanding of the game. This sacrifice is brilliant! "||Please click on the variation to understand what would happen should Black have played R2+3 instead!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]"After gaining back the lost material, black prepares to attack the advisors, slowly disintegrating black's defense..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]"A good move. By retreating the horse, black targets the pawn and also maneuvers the horse in preparation for an attack with the chariot and horse combination..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment82]"And black shows his experience by protecting this side pawn, refusing to give red any chance of trying to go for a draw. This is the mark of a great Xq player!"||Jim: From move 26 onward, through a series of discovered attacks and discovered checks, Black has reduced red's defence to smithereeens...[/DhtmlXQ_comment82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment108]Black wins!||Black has a checkmate with R4=5 now which is guarded by red's palcorner horse. However, by playing A4-5, Black threatens to capture the red horse. Red's horse is thus captured.||It would be a matter of time before Black wins with overwhelming advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment108]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]Not a good move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]" And the game would most probably be a draw! Black may have gained extra material, but both his horse and cannon are trapped. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]Master Li's suggestions![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]"And red would play R5=3 to offer a chariot exchange. The game would most probably progress to such a stage that red would have more pawns and be better off..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]"Less efficient move!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]"And black would be under attack instead!"||Jim:  The central pawn would still be lost...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]
