[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130103 2005 Zhao XinXin L Xu YinChuan B55||||ECCO:B55 ???????????||ECCO:B55 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Sandwiched Horse Defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement||||Jim: Another file from the net. Very nice play!||Commentary seemed to have been provided by GM Zhuang YuTing.||||This was the first ever KaiWei Real Estate Cup whereby players were to be rated.||After 8 days of fierce competition, the cup ended on the 29th of March in Beijing.||The final results (in descending order) were:||Xu YinChuan, Miao LiMing, Zhao XinXin, Sun YongZheng, Wang Yang, Zhang Jiang, Huang ShiQing, Wang LinNa (female), Li HongJia, Wang Bin, Xu Chao and Miao YongPeng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Jim: For beginners, this is the basic formation of the opening, red's 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement, vs Black's Sandwiched Horse Defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]The most commonly played move by red now would be P7+1 ...||Pls click on the variation to see it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]A proactive counter from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Sacrificing the pawn in the hope of acclerating the pace of the game is a very aggressive move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]As seen from the diagram, this might seem like a good move from red, but in fact, it would give black a chance to counter.||A more steadfast move would be A6+5 to adopt a wait and see attitude. That way, red would be able to counter black's aggressions with better efficiency and precision. ||P5+1 is also no feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]A bold but calculated move!||It shows that black has much confidence in the possible variations that follow.||This chariot sacrifice was also forced by red's proactive play. It would seem that no other move would have similar effects on the game as this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]This is a continuation of the chariot sacricice.||At this point in the game, black has seized control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Red should not have played this move, as after the cannon escapes, red's center is under black's control.||A more stubborn move would be A6+5 to sacrifice back the cannon to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Click on the variation to see why R2+7 was not feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]As can be seen, red is forced to counter sacrifice his chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]And black chooses a more steafast approach to the game, after considering his options.||H6+8 is also feasible but it would lead to fierce attacking play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment106]And red resigned.||In the endgame, black's deployment of his forces slowly but surely nibbled away red's defences. This is a hallmark of GM Xu's play: steadfastness with a hint of viciousness.[/DhtmlXQ_comment106]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]And black would be prepared to capture material. Either way, red would most probably lose.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_50]And black would not be far from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_48]And black would win very quickly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]A more stubborn variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]Moves provided by GM Zhuang YuTing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]And red would still have a fighting chance in the game, even though the postioning of his chess pieces are less than ideal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]And black could cause much mischief.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]And black would poised to gain back his lost pawn.||The position of the black horse would also be very good and versatile, and would give red a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]And red would still have a tiny lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]And black would clearly disadvantaged.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]Another usually seen variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_19]And black could choose to play C2=3 or P3=2 for the next move. Either way, the game would lead to very complex variations for both attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_19]
