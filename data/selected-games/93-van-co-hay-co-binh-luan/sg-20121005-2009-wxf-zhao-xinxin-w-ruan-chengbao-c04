[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121005 2009 wxf Zhao Xinxin w Ruan Chengbao C04||||ECCO:C04 ?????????||ECCO C04 : Central Cannon with 7th Filed horse vs Screen Horse Defense (with double cross river pawn ranked cannons)||||Jim: This game was from one of my more recent books. It is an annotated game by GM Jiang Chuan and female Master Liu Jun. Playing Red is young GM Zhao Xinxin while black is famed Vietnamese IGM Ruan Chengbao, who is one of the strongest Xq players outside of China. These two players met in the 2009 Heng Feng Cup which was held by the WXF. ||Zhao went on to become champion while Ruan was the runner up (no pun intended...).||This is a very short but exciting game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Jiang and Liu: With this move, Red leads black into the opening that he has prepared.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Jiang and Liu: And red sounds the horn for this attack. It is clear that the GM has prepared well for this opening. ||R9+1 would be the move that red usually plays.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Jiang and Liu: This move is to prepare for red to play the central linked horses variation. If the advisor were not raised, black could easily deliver a check on the central file with the cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Jiang and Liu: And black decides to sacrifice an elephant this early in the game! This is to allow his rib chariot to be developed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Jiang and Liu: This is a must make move. Red cannot play P7=6 now or black's would form a strong blockade on the pawn rank. Black would not be far away from victory if that were to happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Jiang and Liu: Red tries to use the horse to stall the development of the black pieces, in order to make up for the the poor development of his chess pieces. However, it is still a rather controversial move and would need more study.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Jiang and Liu: This was a rather weak move, trying to prevent red's horse from going for the elbow horse attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Jiang and Liu: And black has wasted another chance of turning the tables; falling deeper and deeper into red's trap.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Jiang and Liu: And Red retreats his horse. This is to allow the game to be kept complex.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Jiang and Liu: A must make move! After playing this move, red is prepared to capture the chariot with R2+3.||At this stage, although the development of the red chariots is still slow, black's lack of an elephant and empty right flank looks very vulnerable. It can be said that Red has the huge advantage now![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Jiang and Liu: As seen from the board at this stage, Red's analysis of the game is superb. GM Zhao is perhaps the most voracious attacking Xq player in the world today and he shows why in this game!||After deep consideration, using 30 min on the clock...GM Zhao finally decides to...[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]!!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Jiang and Liu: It is evident that Ruan had failed to see this move. He had been distracted with GM Zhao's long period of thinking for this move and had wondered to see the other games playing. And he was in a state of shock when GM Zhao played made his move! And C2=8 was the only move that he could play!||Jim: The entire right black flank is vulnerable now to the tyranny of the red chariot and horse.||The kill that ensues is breathtaking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Jiang and Liu: And the king was led to the rooftop of the palace. A bad place to be![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Jiang and Liu: Red prepares to gain material with this move...||Please click on the variation on the next move to understand why red makes this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Jiang and Liu: And this black move gave red more room to perform his assasin skills.||K5-1 would have been slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]Jiang and Liu: And there is no way that black can defend against the octagonal horse checkmate. ||Black resigned.||Jim: I have added the final few moves to show the beginner why...and ps, the octagonal horse is slightly different from the palcorner horse, although technically they occupy the same positions. In the octagonal horse, the king is directly opposite the horse as in this position, held motionless by the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]Jiang and Liu: And it would also be a kill with the Angler Horse Checkmate.||Jim: For beginners, red would simply checkmate with R8+1 followed by R8=6. The position of the horse now is known as the angler horse position (yes, angler as in fisherman).[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]Jim: Say black makes this move ...||I added this variation to show what was meant by Red's plans when he played R8-1 on the previous move....[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_57]And red would also win after capturing the chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]Jiang and Liu's suggested move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_65]Jiang and Liu: And black would still be able to hold on to the game. Perhaps Ruan had not gotten over red's R2+3 sacrifice earlier![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]Jiang and Liu: And red would force an exchange ! Even so, black would be unable to maintain his blockade.||Jim: Whew...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_36]Jiang and Liu: Not advisable![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_39]Jiang and Liu: And black would not want this to happen![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_35]Jiang and Liu: "If ..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]Jiang and Liu: And the pace of the game would have slowed down. It would be easier to read and understand the game for both players.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_32]Jiang and Liu: Suggested move.||GM Liu Dahua had taken black and defeated GM Xu Tianhong in the past with this variation and so has a multitude of other players.||But GM Zhao and his multitude of "computer coaches" must have discovered something that had deepened their understanding of this variation, and one is left to wonder!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_33]Jiang and Liu: To prepare for R9=6 for the attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_34]Jiang and Liu: And black's chariots are better positioned and is in control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]Jiang and Liu: And this horse could be easily captured, being alone in enemy territory without backup.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]Move suggested by GM Jiang and Master Liu[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_31]Jim: This move was given as E7+9 in my book, but i think it is a misprint.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_33]Jiang and Liu: And black should be satisfied with this outcome too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_33]Jim: This variation was not found in the book. I cannot understand understand why red cannot take the chariot...||Red would still be better !!![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_31]"Move given in book..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_32]And red would lose the chariot soon!||Black would win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_33]And black would be sastified with the state of things!||Jim: That is why I think that E7+9 was a misprint and that move should be E3+1 instead. Black would surely exchange his cannon for red's chariot now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_33]
