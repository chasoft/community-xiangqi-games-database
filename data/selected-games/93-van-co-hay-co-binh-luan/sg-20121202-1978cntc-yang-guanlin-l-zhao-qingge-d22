[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121202 1978cntc Yang GuanLin L Zhao QingGe D22||||ECCO:D22 ???????||ECCO:D22 Sdc: fr vs rr||||Jim: An interesting file I found over the net. A sdc game played in the 5th round of the 1978 Chinese National Team Championsips in XiaMen, FuJian province.||Red was GM Yang GuanLin while Black was Master Zhao QingGe, who was a famous player in that era and has also authored quite a few XiangQi books. I  think I lost his books over 2 decades ago when my parents moved house... ||Commentary was provided by Chen XiaoWei???, and Chen RiXu???.||Interesting comments.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]By playing the central cannon for the first move, red shows his aggressive intent. Playing the side horse now shows that red does not want a rapid game, but instead would prefer a slow but steady game.||However, the lack of aggressiveness would also be viable to black's retaliation. ||Jim: Such wordy or ???comments were the norm back then.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Black shows his aggressive intentions by advancing the cannon to red's pawn rank. ||Black has seen through red's intentions and has decided to go on the aggressive. ||Black's moves show that he is prepared to snatch control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black uses 2 chariots and 1 cannon to attack red's left flank and also the central file with the cannon.||This is quite aggressive but on the flip side of the coin, black's horses are prone to capture by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Red prepares to move the chariot to the rib file and develop his chariot from that file, and target black's horses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]At this stage in the game, black has finished deploying his forces and has successfully used his cannons to put a wrench in red's plans to deploy his forces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And black boldly advances the chariot, preparing to exchange his horse for red's cannon. This was intended to lower red's defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red preferred to keep his defences intact while ignoring black's threat.||Red has opted for a slow and steady game when he played H8+9 and this move can be thought of as a continuation of red's strategy in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]This is a farsighted move. Playing the elephant is to allow black's chariot to advance forward, so that black can use his horse to exchange for the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]This is a bold move!||Black exercised great precision in calculation as he would have to consider the consequences of the loss of the chariot. ||This sacrifice would level red's defenses and is a successful example of an exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]After the exchange, red's right chariot would have to be used to protect the king and would be thus pinned to that file temporarily. Only his left horse and chariot are now mobile. ||As for black, although he had lessened the pressure that red had given him beforehand, his pieces are still inadequately developed.||Therefore, at this stage in the game, red should have played R6+6 instead to further limit the space of black. H9+8 would not seem so good now. ||The game would be a standoff and red would still be in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]This was a mistake on red's part. H8+6 would have been a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]!!! And black blocks the red horse from protecting the chariot with this threat to kill!||Black has gained material now and has the obvious advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Black has the mateiral advantage. ||By exchanging cannons, black would prevent red from trying to get back into the game.  ||After the exchange, black would have an extra horse and more pawns than red, giving red no chance to try to mount a comeback.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment64]Red refuted the exchange offer, so black decides to start attacking.||The game is coming to a climax.[/DhtmlXQ_comment64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]By retreating the horse, black threatens to capture the red horse while at the same time protecting this side pawn.||Black's advantage just increased![/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment90]And black sacrifices his central pawn by charging his horse forward.||Black is now prepared to embrace the final victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment90]
[DhtmlXQ_comment98]And red resigned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment98]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_57]And although red is down materially, he has made up for some of the loss with this move. Black is going to lose either the elephant or the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]Andit wouldbe a standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]
