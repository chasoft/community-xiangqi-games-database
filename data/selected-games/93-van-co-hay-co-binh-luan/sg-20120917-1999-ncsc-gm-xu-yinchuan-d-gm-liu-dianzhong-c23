[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120917 1999 ncsc GM Xu Yinchuan D GM Liu Dianzhong C23 ||ECCO C23 Central cannon with pawn ranked chariot and 7th filed horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double headed snake pawn formation.||ECCO:C23 ???????????????||||Jim: Special thanks must be given to Chris Hanksinson for donating this game!!! Comments are by GM Liu Dianzhong himself and Chris has done a nice job of translating. I have added footnotes to help the beginner understand where necessary.||||This game was played in the fifth round of the National Individual Championship, each player having ??2.5 points fromt he first 4 rounds, and now the two leaders meet for a bitter struggle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Black plays P7+1. Since the Guandong players are very fond of the 5 7 Cannon variation with 3rd soldier advanced, it is a good idea to avoid it![/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Red traverses the chariot to force and exchange early. ||I had played this variatin against Shenzhen's Master Liu Xing back in 1997.||It seemed that the Guangdong team had taken note of this variation and after much study and improvisions, it became quite a lethal weapon for them, producing good results.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]In this years championships (1999), in the second round, there had been two similar games played with this variation. ||Please click on the variations to see them... ||In this game, I chose to play R1=4. In retrospect, it would not seem as a very mature concept. A better move would still be C8+2, to wait for red to play E7+5 and then advance my horse H3+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Black advances the horse for an exchange. ||This would be a better move than R4+6!||Click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Prior to the game, I had not dismissed the possibility that GM Xu would use this variation. So, after some study, I designed the H6+4 variation. Unfortunately, it did not produce the results that I had hoped.||The main reason was that I had conceived of this variation 15 minutes prior to the game and was unable to contemplate the variation in greater depth.||I believe the crucial factor was the way red had played the elephant. In my mind, I had expected that red would play E7+5 instead of E3+5.||If indeed black had played E7+5, I could have chosen to continue with C8+5...||(Please click on the variation below to understand what went through GM Liu's mind...)||But in the actual game, GM Xu played this elephant instead!||||    ????????????????????????,?????????6?4???,????????????????,????1 5????,??????????????????????,????????????,?????8?5,????5?4???,???????????????,?????8?5,??????,???5?4,?????????,????????????????????????,???????????,?????[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]But in the actual game, GM Xu played this elephant instead! If I had continued with C8+5 ...||(Please click on the variation to understand what GM Liu was concerned about...)||That is why, in the actual game, I chose P3+1, for the chariot exchange.||That lead to my cannon and chariot being pinned by  red's chariot and I was on the receiving end going into the endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]With this move, black tries to free himself from red's pin with a possible R8=7 to exchange cannon for horse, thereby simplifying the game.||This was perhaps the most crucial move in this game, a move that would decide the outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]After some hard work, red achieved more space to maneuver this chess pieces and was now prepared to concentrate his chess pieces to oppress black's room to move.||In retrospect, P9+1 would seem to be a bad move as trying to protect this pawn would actually increase the difficulty of forcing a draw! ||Black should have played H6-7 and try to play H9+7. It would have been easier that way.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Red read the game accurately and with this move, red had prevented black from playing H6-7 to try to give his cannon a root.||This turn of events placed much pressure on black and the gravity and implications were severe.||Black was thus forced to retreat the horse out of desperation.||If black had one retreated his horse, red could have played P5+1 and the black horse would be left  with even less room to maneuver. ||Jim: It would become a sitting horse (or duck if you insist)...[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]Black is forced to go for an exchange![/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]At this stage, the endgame formation reached is quite rare. ||Red could not have chosen to play C4=8 or C4=2 ...||(Please click on the variation below to understand why )[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]By retreating the chariot, black awards himself a chance of forcing a draw! ||Please click on the variation below to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment109]At this stage, red has two other choices...||(Please click on the variation to see for yourself!)[/DhtmlXQ_comment109]
[DhtmlXQ_comment111]In the previous move, the black king was still exposed, and it might been the optimal time to play for red to choose to play E5+3. However, I believe that even if red had done so, it would still be hard for red to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment111]
[DhtmlXQ_comment112]And after black had retreated his king to the confines of the palace, the degree of difficulty for red to win the game would greatly increase.[/DhtmlXQ_comment112]
[DhtmlXQ_comment115]R9+7 would probably lead to a draw too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment118]After nearly 30 rounds of positioning his pieces, red  sounds his attack.||This sacrifice is the best move to force a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment118]
[DhtmlXQ_comment146]Draw. ||(Please click on the following moves that GM Liu used to explain why!)||Looking back at this game, black had chosen a not so desirable opening that still needs to be studied.||Luckily for black, in the endgame, appropriate movement of the chess pieces and timely exchanges and sacrifices saved the day. The last few moves were quite like moves that you would expect from endgame compositions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment146]
[DhtmlXQ_comment148]And after capturing the side pawn, even if red's chariot were to wipe out the pawns, the endgame would be simplified to that of 1r d 2a2e.[/DhtmlXQ_comment148]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_150]And if the cannon were allowed to retreat back to his own territory, it would be a draw also!||Jim: Black could simply play C7=1 and sacrifice his cannon and side pawn for red's pawn to simplify the endgame into a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_150]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_125]And red would be able to protect his last pawn.||If that were allowed, black would have a tough time trying to force a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_125]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_124]And it would still be a draw after the pawns are exchanged.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_124]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_128]And black could stubbornly defend with C6-3 on the next move.||It would take red much effort to win![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_128]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_110]And it would be nearly impossible to draw the game now![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_110]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_114]And black could now choose to which side red pawn to attack, depending on how red played.||Once red is able to capture another pawn, it would become very drawish![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_114]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_68]And red would still have a very hard time trying to win![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_63]If red chose to gain material, the cannon and chariot would be unable to free themselves from the pin that black had exerted and the game would have simply ended in a premature draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_68]And it would still be a draw as red would not be able to free its chariot and cannon from red's pin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_61]And black would lose material, and the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_32]Why black cannot continue with his pre-conceived game plan...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_35]GM Xu could have defended his advisor with this move!||Black would be in deep trouble now![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_31]GM Liu's pre-game plan...||GM Liu had expected that red would play this move instead of E3+5 in the actual competition.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_32]And black would be able to hold his own against red.||Black could threaten with K5=4![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_43]And red would have the advantage of an extra elephant and be in control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_26]GM Xu Yinchuan (Guangdong) vs GM Wan Chunlin (Shanghai) &||Master Huang Hailin (Guangdong) W Master Zhang Jiang (Hebei)[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_28]GM Xu Yinchuan (Guangdong) vs GM Wan Chunlin (Shanghai).[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_45]And red had the significant advantage and would eventually win the game.||GM Xu Yinchuan (Guangdong) vs GM Wan Chunlin (Shanghai).[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]Master Huang Hailin (Guangdong) W Master Zhang Jiang (Hebei)[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_39]And red would have amassed a huge advantage in this game.||Red would go on to win the game. ||Master Huang Hailin (Guangdong) W Master Zhang Jiang (Hebei)[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_39]
