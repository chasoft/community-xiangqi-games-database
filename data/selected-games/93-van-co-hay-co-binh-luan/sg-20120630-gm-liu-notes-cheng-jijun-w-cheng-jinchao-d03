[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120630 GM Liu notes Cheng Jijun W Cheng Jinchao D03||ECCO D03 Same Direction Cannons: Ranked chariot vs slow chariot||ECCO:D03 ????????||||This is one of the files from a series of commentated games or lectures by GM Liu Dianzhong. ||GM Liu shows his wisdom and analysis in this series of games. Very nice comments![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]"When red uses the double ranked chariots to attack, another variation would be to play C8+4 , which has been covered in another topic.."   ||Jim: Forgive me, I have yet to find that board![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]"Exchanging the pawns is one possible variation. Black can also consider E7+5..."||Pls click on the variation to understand GM Liu's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]"This move is problematic. Black should have played R8+2..."||Pls click on the variation below to understand GM Liu's recommendations![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]"Black cannot accept the exchange now as his right chariot is still undeveloped. If he accepted the challenge, red would have control of all the important points/files/ranks on the board!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]"R6=3 is not an option!"||Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]"Looking back at red's moves in the past few moves would show his farsightedness. Pushing the cannon forward before advancing the central pawn has successfully prevented black from playing the riverbank cannon (C2+2). This way, black's defenses are limited and has trouble adjusting its formation!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]"Good move! With this exchange, red gains momentum in his attack! Black would be in a dilemma wheter to accept the challenge or not!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]"Black would be worse off if he played C5-3 now!"||Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]"Very skilled play seen here! By maneuvering the chariot, red actually gains an extra move! This is the correct order of moves played. "||Please click on the variation below to understand what would happen if red played K5=4 to go for the kill immediately.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment64]"This is the move that loses the game for black! A better move would be C2=3. If black is able to capture either one of the red side pawns, a draw would be imminent."  ||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]"And red wins!"||Jim: Red would go on to capture the two black side pawns. 1r2p would be more than what black's 1c2a2e can handle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]GM Liu's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]"All that black has to do now is to capture either one of the side pawns for the draw!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_57]nope...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_60]"And black would have lived to fight another day!||Black's pawn advantage would mean that he is now on the winning end instead!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]Nope...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_55]"And red would have a very strong attack going on!||The reason for black's plight is because he had developed his right chariot too slow in the game. The chariot is the most powerful piece in Xiangqi, and its development would have a direct effect on the outcoem of the game. This game is a very good example to show this fundamental opening theory."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]"And red would be forced to play R2-4! That way, black would follow with R1=2, developing his chariot and attacking the weak and disoriented left flank with the same move! Red would lag behind in the game them."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]"And now black has two threats: A skewer with C6+5 or trying to capture the chariot with H7+6.||Either way, red would be in trouble."[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]"And black's current state of affairs is not bad!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
