[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130324 2007 Hu RongHua L Yu YouHua C66||||ECCO:C66 ????????7?||ECCO:C66 57 Cannons vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement Variation. ||||  ???????????7? ||||Jim: Another rather recent game played. Nice game.||Master Yang DeQi ????? was the commentator.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And after 5 rounds of play, both players have chosen a very popular and fashionable opening.||It is also one opening that everybody has their eyes on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]C8+2 and C8+4 are another two often played variations with their own set of strategies for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]E7+5 and E3+5 are another two commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Antoher commonly played variation would be R8+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Correct move to play. ||H7+6 would probably result in red holding the advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Another fashionable variation would be for red to attack the elephant immediately with R3+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]H3+4 and H3+2 have also been tried before, and both would lead to very complex variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Correct move to play.||C7+7 would be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]GOOD MOVE!||Black prepares to counter with a central cannon of his own![/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And red starts to attack, showing his aggression.||A less volatile possibility would be R2=6 to control the rib files and then look for chances to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]R2=7 to attempt to capture the black horse would be another interesting option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Red could also consider C7=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Over the last few moves, although red had regained lost material, his pieces are now badly positioned.||Black on the other hand, has now managed to organize his pieces into a fearsome attacking force.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]And black won the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]And black would still be able to handle red's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_14]And red could choose to attack with P3+1 or P9+1. ||Both variations would lead to very complex situations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_14]
