[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130304 2004 nsmeet Hu RongHua L Zhao GuoRong C66 ||ECCO:C66 ????????7?||ECCO:C66 57 Cannons vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement||||Jim:another file from the internet. Hu RongHua vs Zhao GuoRong. Commentary was provided by Master Zhang XiaoPing. ||||On the 26th of February, 2004, a north GM vs south GM friendly was held in TianJing's MeiDu Hotel. ||Representing the South were GMs Hu RongHua, Lv Qin, Xu YinChuan, Xu TianHong and Wan ChunLin.||The North team were composed of GMs Zhao GuoRong, Liu DaHua, Tao HanMing, Liu DianZhong and Yu YouHua.||It was a single round robin and there were 5 rounds with 5 matches per round. The winning team would be decided by the total accumulated points.||This match was played in the 3rd round, whereby GM Zhao GuoRong took black and defeated GM Hu RongHua.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And the basic opening formation has been decided.||Red has used the 57 Cannons while black has answered with the Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Other commonly played variations include C8+4/C2+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And black has opted for a more steadfast game with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]P3+1 is another viable option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red could also choose to play R8+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]This is one of the older ways of playing this opening. ||The main idea is to keep the game a closed one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]R2-3 is another possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Black would build up momentum if red played R2+2 to capture the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Good move!||From here on, black would start a blithering counter attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]As can be seen from the past few moves, black had opted to sacrifice two pawns in exchange for control of the game.||Red must not have seen this coming![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]And red is forced to play this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And red would have used one chariot to exchange for black's two horses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Another good move!||After moving the cannon to this file, black's advantage would increase by leaps and bounds.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Red could have considered P9+1 and it would seem to be better than what went on in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]And black shows vigilance and a nose for danger with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Black traverses the chariot to take aim at red's horse. This was made in conjunction with his threat to play C3+5. ||This would deny red any chance of a breather.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Very delicate move, allowing black to maintain the equilibrum of the pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]And this was perhaps the move responsible for red's fall.||From here on, red goes downhill rapidly.||R2+1 would have been better as it would still have been a close game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]And black starts another campaign on the other flank at the same time.||Red would now have much trouble trying to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]A5-6 would also not be feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment64]And red resigned after losing material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]And red would not be able to hold on much longer.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_47]And red would start to counter-attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]And red would also have a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_36]And red would be sure to lose a chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]And black would have built some momentum.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]Another viable alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]And it would be a relatively even situation for both.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_18]And red could choose to play C2=4 or C2=6, both of which are relatively steadfast options.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]Another viable option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]And red would still command the control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]Aggressive variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]And both players would quickly meet head-on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]
