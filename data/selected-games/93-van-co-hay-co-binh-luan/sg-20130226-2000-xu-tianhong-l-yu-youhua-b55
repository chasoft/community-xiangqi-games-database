[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130226 2000 Xu TianHong L Yu YouHua B55||||ECCO:B55 ???????????||ECCO:B55 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Sandwiched Horse Defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement.||||Jim: Another file found on the internet which used the openings that I have been uploading recently.||Commentary was provided by openings expert, Master Yan WenQing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Jim: Left elephant variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]In the early stages of the game, both players played the variations that they were most comfortable with.||Advancing the central pawn is to try to limit the effects of black's pawn ranked cannon, and is one of the most commonly used counters today (Jim: year 2000). ||In the past P7+1 was played...[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Advancing the edge pawn would allow red's horse into action. This would effectively prevent R2+5 from black.||P7+1 is another alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Black sacrifices the central pawn to allow his horse to be positioned at the riverbank.||This is a new variation.||In actual play, R9=6 to prepare for C6+5 was usually played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Sacrificing the pawn would imply that red is prepared to attack the central black pawn. It would also mean that the climax of the battle would come soon.||A steadfast approach to the game would be to play A4+5 but it would become a standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And black defends while at the same time prepares  an attack!||Playing this move would also prevent red from playing R8+3. ||This is a very strong move with a very strong recoil![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]By advancing the cannon to this position, black gets to deliver a discovered attack. His horse would now be prepared to exchange for red's central cannon, while at the same time, allow himself control of this rib file.||If black played nonchanlantly with R2+4, red would gain material![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]In retropsect, this move would seem to slow and inefficient.||H3+4 might be a better option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Advancing the cannon now would allow black to play C6=2 to gain material! It would also allow black to play H3+4 to gain momentum in attacking.||A very powerful move![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Weak move.||Red had hoped naively that black's intention would be foiled with this move.||In retrospect, this was not an efficient move and does not do much.||Once black sees through red's intentions, black could counter easily and viciously and red would be disadvantaged strategically.||H3+4 now would seem to be the better option, as it would allow red to look for various attacking possibilities![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black spoils red's trap with this move. It also allows him to gain more momentum.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And this move is perhaps the move most responsible for red's downfall.||Perhaps, black's aggressions and tactical combinations over the past few moves have had much pressure on red, causing red to lose his cool.||If red were calm, he would find out that A4+5 or H3+2 would be the better move to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]As can be seen, black advances his chariot for attack and forks the red horse and elephant.||A loss for red would seem inevitable.||The best that red could do now is to try to counter each of black's aggressions move for move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]K5+1 or E5+7 would also not save red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]C2=5 would seem to be another viable option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]And red resigned.||Black's chariot is now very well positioned and prepared to play H2+4 or R3+5 as possibile attacking options.||Red sees that resistance was futile and resigned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]Another attacking possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]And red would also have a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]And red would have a hard time trying to get out of the mess that he was in.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]And black would also have the signficant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]And although black would be slightly better now, black would still need to put in much effort to increase his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]This would be red's intended trap.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]And red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]And black would be trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_33]And red would gain back lost material in the exchange, while at the same time control this rib file.||Red would still hold on to the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]And red would gain material![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]This would seem to be passive play from black![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_23]And black would have a hard time dealing with red's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_19]And the game would easily become a standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]Or black could also choose to play H6+4! to attack.||Red would have a hard time controlling the game, and black would have many chances of launching a counter attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]Best move against black's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_24]And black would have sacrificed material early for an attack. However, it is generally believed that red would have the material advantage and that in the game that follows, red would have the better chance.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_25]And red would have the slight lead going into midgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_22]And it would be a standoff. A rather even game for both parties.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_20]And after the exchange, black would be satisfied with the outcome. Red's left chariot would have a hard time developing and red's primary threat in the form of the right chariot would have been eliminated.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_21]And it would rapidly become an aggressive fireworks filled game for both.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_19]And red would often sacrifice his pawns to allow his chariot to mount a rapid attack.||The battle would become very complicated but it would still be a relatively even game with both sides having their chances.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_19]
