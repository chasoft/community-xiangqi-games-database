[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120324 2005 Nianhai Cup Lv Qin L Liu Dahua||ECCO: C49 Central cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation. ||ECCO:C49 ?????????????????||This game was played in 2005 during the Chinese New Year. It was an exhibition match and both GMs were invited to Shunde for a friendly||After 2 matches, GM Liu won with 1W1D.  ||The moves were commented by GM Liu Dahua himself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And GM Lv chooses the rapid central pawn advancement variation of this opening.||GM Liu chose to play R3=4 which is a little bit unusual, hoping to bring to his game an element of surprise. ||H7+8 is normally played. Please click on the variation below to see it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]GM Lv had hoped to exchange his chariot for black's chariot and horse but in retrospect, the results were not desirable.||C8=9 to develop his left chariot would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And black hits red where it hurts most![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]???[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Post game analysis suggests this was the move that caused red the game.||C5=1 to readjust red's formation would still allow red to have a game going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Black starts his attack. ||This is a very goal targeted move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]Black is forced to sacrifice the cannon. If the cannon runs away, black would have a kill with R9=4. (black would play K5=4)...[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]And red resigns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]Another questionable/interesting comment....[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]And black would win![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]Hmm, this suggested move was questionable.||Perhaps it was a typing mistake. This was a file found on the net....[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]The comments suggested that black would try for an  exchange with R4=2 and red would not have much of a baseline attack. Black would be better .[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]Commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]And red would be slightly better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]
