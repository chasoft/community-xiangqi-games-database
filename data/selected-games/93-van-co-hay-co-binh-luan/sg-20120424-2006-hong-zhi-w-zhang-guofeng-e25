[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120424 2006 Hong Zhi W Zhang Guofeng||E25 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon Variation vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation||ECCO:E25 ???????????????||Another male vs female GM match!||GM Hong Zhi(M) goes up against GM Zhang Guofeng(F) in this exciting match.||All of GM Zhang's matches are a pleasure to watch.||This match was one of the highlight matches in the A league, in the Qixin Golf Cup 2006?�??????".||Comments were passed by GM Master Song Guoqiang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Back ground knowledge: ||ECCO assigns P3+1 as the first move for the Angel's Pawn or Angel's Guide as the WXF calls it. ||Therefore the moves given in this match were actually mirror images of the more contemporary opening names.||||For beginner, moving the left elephant to the center and moving the right elephant to the center are very very different, leading to very different styles of games played. ||||In the same competition in round 3, Master Yang Deqi played E7+5 against Master Zhang Qiang.||Please click on the variation below to see what happened in that game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And red tests black out with this move.||Under normal circumstances, red would have played one of the following two options: C5=6 or C9=5 ...||Please click on the variation below to understand see some of the contemporary variations :[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black chooses to wait and see also.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]According to Master Song, this was not a good move. This elephant move actually causes red's left flank to be empty and prone to attack from black, who has slowly concentrated all his chess pieces on this side of the board.||Master Song suggests P9+1 ... please click on the variation ....[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Very versatile move from the female GM!!!||This move would be better than playing C2=1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]After a series of exchanges, the objectives of both sides have become clear. ||Red's C9+4 is a good move.||If red played C9=8, it would not be that good...||C6=8 would also leave black in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]And red sacrifices a pawn to stir things up!||Another option would be to play C9+1..(suggested by Master Song)[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]This move to readjust red's formation would seem slow.||H3+4 would have been more proactive![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]For the past few moves, black plays with finesse, leaving no room for red to increase his lead. Great play for the female GM!||If black were to play H9+7...it would be disastrous!||Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]This is another controversial move from red! ||Master Song suggest P8+1!||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]Good move!||Black prevents a discovered attack with red playing C4+2! Good play from the female GM![/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]This would seem a little bit toooooo risky from red.||Black would have a chance![/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment66]Ouch...||According to Master Song, black should have moved H6+8 for the elbow horse in the other direction. It would be a much more proactive move. ||Plase click on the variation to see Master Song's suggestions! Very nice moves !!![/DhtmlXQ_comment66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]This move was thought to be too hasty...||Black should have played H2+4 and she would still be in control. Red would still be NOT out of the woods...[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment71]And red sets a trap for black, sacrificing his elephant. ||Black falls for it, and basically from here on, red is ensured of a victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment79]And Black resigns...||Black is bound to lose material now. ||The remaining red pawns and material advantage would be prove too much for black... ||||On a personal note, GM Zhang Guofeng must have given GM Hong Zhi a huge scare!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]Suggested move!!!||Master Song suggests that red has three options to choose from....[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_67]Option 1:[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]Nice![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_78]And black would not be too far away from a win![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_67]Option 2:[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_72]And black would still be faster going in for the kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_67]Option 3:[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_70]And black's forces would be all over the place...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_53]Master Song's recommedations...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_54]correct move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_59]Red with the advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_55]and red would be in a very good position!||Red has C9=5 (threatening to checkmate with R++4).||No matter what black moves, red would be on the aggressive side![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_52]nope, not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_59]And red would have increased his lead greatly!||Black would be on the receiving end![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]and red would still have the lead firmly in control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]Not advisable![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_44]And black gains material!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_38]and black would have gained the lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_31]And red would have the upperhand witht the cross river pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_19]Master Song's recommendation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]And it would be an early standoff![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_23]And red would have the initiative firmly grasped.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_16]If black chose to play this move instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_17]the black chariot would be functionless now. Red would have gained the advantage and increased his momentum in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_15]Option number one: C5=6[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_24]And it would be a knotty game...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_15]Option number 2:[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]And it would be a relatively even game. Both sides have their pros and cons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_4]Round 3 game of 2006 Qixin Golf Cup whereby red's Master Yang Deqi went up against Master Zhang Guoqiang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_16]And both sides fight for the initiative of the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment16_16]
