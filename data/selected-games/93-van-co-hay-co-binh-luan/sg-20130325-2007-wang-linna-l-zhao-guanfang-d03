[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130325 2007 Wang LinNa L Zhao GuanFang D03||||ECCO:D03 ????????||ECCO:D03 Same Direction Cannons: Ranked Chariot vs Slow/Deferred Chariot||???????||||Jim: Another file from the net. ||Commentary was given by GM Dang GuoLei??? for this match by another two GMs. Please do not care about the ECCO, I think it is one of the faulty ones. Whenever red plays R1+1 in this variation, it would give it D03, whereby it should be classified as a ranked chariot vs filed chariot match of the same direction cannons.||||This was the match played in the last round of the  6th ever JiaZhou Cup ???, whereby only GMs were eligible for competition.||Whoever won this game would be crowed the Champion of the females division.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Both players have had many encounters and were very familiar with each other's style of play.||Red chooses to play the ranked chariot on the second move, hoping to bring the game into the variations that she was more familiar with.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This is a more proactive counter from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]It would seem that red would not have any other better move to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Ingenious play. With this move, red's chances of increasing her lead are grealy dampened.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Black does not care about her elephant on the bottom rank; rather, she chose to position her chariot on the riverbank.||It shows her courage and determination to win and is quite a trademark of her style.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]C3+8 now would give black a chance to pin black's horse and chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]Good move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]After the game, GM Wang felt that she should have played C1=3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]C2-1 would have been better as it would still apply a certain amount of pressure on black's left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment59]In the previous few moves, black has successfully managed to move her pieces to good positions.||She could be satisfied with the current state of affairs.||Red, on the other hand, might have succumbed to the pressures of competition when she made his blunder. Red's game would spiral downward from here on![/DhtmlXQ_comment59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]GOOD MOVE!||And black seizes control of the game from red.||Black would now have the obvious advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment74]Jim: For beginners, black did play C2=4 as red would simply gain back the cannon with K5+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment112]P3+1 is another viable alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment112]
[DhtmlXQ_comment113]H7+6 is not viable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment113]
[DhtmlXQ_comment127]In the endgame, try as she might, red could not manage to force a draw as she was lagged too far behind. A loss for red was inevitable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment127]
[DhtmlXQ_comment128]And black won the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment128]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_116]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_116]And black would also win after capturing the red horse with this check.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_52]And red could play P7+1!||Red would still not lose material and still have a cannon on black's bottom rank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_43]And after the exchange, red would have the advantage material wise with the elephant.||Red would have an easier time in the game too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]And black would be able to pin the red chariot and horse with this move. It would be a worthwhile sacrifice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]And black would get a chance to adjust her formation and start to counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]And red would be applying much pressure to black's  left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]
