[DhtmlXQ_comment0]20120318 2004 A League Bu Fengbo W Tao Hanming B34||ECCO B34 Central Cannon with Right ranked chariot vs Sandwiched Horse Defense.||ECCO:B34 ?????????||Another file found on the net. In this game, Red's GM Bu Fengbo went up against Black's GM Tao Hanming. ||GM Bu has performed consistently for the past 2 decades and was awarded GM in 1998 for his very high winning percentage.  ||GM Tao Hanming needs no further introduction. ||The comments were given by another Xiangqi master, Master Yang Deqi, who is very well known for his openings. (Please go see the videos by Master Zhang Qiang and you will hear much praise of Master Yang Deqi). ||This game was one of the more exciting games in the General's Cup in 2004, which was one of the tournaments in the A League. ||It was round 18 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]P7+1 is also an alternative. ||By playing the horse first, black lets red choose which pawn to push ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This would be the basic opening formation : ||Central cannon with right ranked chariot vs Sandwiched Horse Defense. ||Please refer to the openings section where there is a board discussing this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Red does not hide his intentions. A blatant attack down the center!||Black fights back and answers with the central cannon. These are both very targeted moves from both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This is one commonly used technique. ||The aim for black is to break the link between the horses, thereby weakening red's attack down the center. It is also better than playing P3+1 now... ||Please click on the variation below to understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Correct move!!!||Please click on the variations below to see other commonly played variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Master Yang suggests that black could have played R2+6 now for a more aggressive approach.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]GM Tao chooses to be aggressive with this move. ||For players who prefer to go slow and steady, R2+4 to guard the river would also be an alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]At this stage, red has the significant upperhand. ||Not only has he the better chess piece combination, all his chess pieces are very well positioned. Huge advantage to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]The move that completely takes GM Tao by surprise!||It is also the move that wins the game for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Hmm, a controversial move...||Perhaps R2=8 would be better...[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]Red wins!||There is no way that black can resolve R5=6 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_15]Another commonly played variation ....[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]Black can be satisfied with this outcome and the pressure would be on red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_15]Another commonly played variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]R4=3 is not advisable now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_40]And both players would be in attacking mode in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]not advised![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]!!! ||And black would have seized the lead from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]Not advised as it actually slows the development of black's chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]And red would have the firm advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_6]Another commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]And black's left ranked chariot would still be able to suppress red's intentions of attacking the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
