[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120307 2010 jjls Pan Zhenbo L Zheng Weitong||This is a short game played in 2010/9/29. I chose this game to show how a tiny, not very obvious mistake in the opening can have drastic consequences. It is also an introduction of two up and coming players in China.||Taking Red is Master Pan Zhenbo. Master Pan was born in 1974 and hails from Liaoning but he is representing Shandong province now. He was awarded the title of Xiangqi Master in 1994 by coming in 10th place in the National Chinese Xiangqi Championships, and improving his placings to 4th place in 2004, before improving to 2nd place in 2005. His greatest claim to fame was winning the 2007 Singles Tournament held by the AXF.||Taking Black is Master Zheng Weitong from Chengdu, Sichuan. He is one of China's pride. Born in 1994,he is also one of the youngest Xq stars. Zheng's first claim to fame was in 2006 when he won the under 12 Chinese National Championbships, and again in 2008 when he won the under 14, and again in 2009 in the under 16. He made Xiangqi master in 2009 by coming 11th place in the 2009 Chinese National Singles Championship.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This variation is one of the more contemporary variations of this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]C4+3 is another commonly played variation. Interesting move.||Black tries to gain material with P7+1 with this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Red attempts to capture the black chariot with a discovered check (C2=5), although he uses up a move.||Pls click on the variation below to see other commonly played moves...[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black prevents red's C2=5 with this move, and chooses the center as his target for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This seemingly innocent move by Master Zheng is full of cunning![/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Post-game analysis deems this move as the cause for red's failure! ||Black has a surprise waiting!!!||It was suggested that red play R9+1 instead, and it would still be a long way to go.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And red sees his folly!||He is forced to accept this exchange!||Please click on the variation to understand what would happen if red refuted the exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And black gains material![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Red tries to simplify the game...[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]But by now, black has the obvious advantage!||It would be hard even for red to try to force a draw now![/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]To force a draw, red must try by all means to capture the black pawns and at the same time, prevent the black horse from joining the attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And the young Master Zheng shows great patience by attempting to further simplify the game to an sure-win endgame for him. With this move, he also prevents any chance of possible mischief when the red cannon moves away for a discovered check. ||If red does not accept the exchange and plays R5-1, the red pawn is lost and all hope is lost for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]And the red pawn is pinned temporarily to the sidelines. There is nowhere it can move and it is basically functionless.||The remaining black and red pawn take the center stage now. ||If red were able to destroy that black pawn, and even charge his pawn across the river, he could still force a draw.||Black understands the gravity of the situation and  a fight for control of the pawns erupts.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]If red insisted on playing C5=1, black would play H4+3 to check followed by H3-5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]And red resigns in this short game.||The red pawn is definitely lost and red's side pawn is a sitting duck waiting to be captured. ||Black would slowly torture red by pushing the pawn across the river for a final checkmate.||Master Zheng, aged 16 when this game was played, beats the 2007 Asian Xiangqi Champion with beauty!||What were you doing when you were 16? .... LOL.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_67]Why the black pawn is poisoned...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_70]And red would have to play C1=4 to resolve this check. 1h1c vs 2p...Black would definitely win now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]say red makes any move other than exchaning the chariots...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]!!! Black would countersacrifice a chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]and there is no way to resolve the checkmate of C5=4 from black!||Black wins, just like that![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]And the game quickly simplifies to 1r1h1c3p2a2e vs 1r1h1c2p2a2e. Red is still slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]
