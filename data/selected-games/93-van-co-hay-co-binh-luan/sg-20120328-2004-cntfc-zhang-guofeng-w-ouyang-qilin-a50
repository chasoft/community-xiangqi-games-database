[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120328 2004 cntfc Zhang Guofeng W Ouyang Qilin||ECCO: A50 Palcorner Cannon (vs Opposite Direction Cross Palace Cannon)||ECCO:A50 ????||||Another game found. It was commented by the winner of the game itself, GM Zhang Guofeng from Jiangsu Province. I have directly translated GM Zhang's own comments, adding quotation marks.||"It was round 5 of the Chinese National Xiangqi Team Championships, females division. Our team, ( team representing Jiangsu Province) had just amassed a record of 3W1D and our next opponent was Shanghai. To achieve our ultimate goal, we had to have an even better performance!" ||-- Zhang Guofeng.||||Shanghai's GM Ouyang Qinlin was a long time rival and the two have had many matches against each other. ||GM Zhang Guofeng's one of the most exciting female players to watch in Xiangqi. See this game and you will know why![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]" I gave up using the central cannon and choose this relatively less used opening for the hope of taking the less trodden path. " -- GM Zhang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]"And GM Ouyang spent a little bit of a time thinking before playing this move, the opposite direction cross palace cannon. I guess we both did not want to play the usual moves and wanted to  choose the midgame and endgame as our real battleground. " -- GM Zhang ||||For beginners, this was indeed a relatively rare red opening for red, and an even more rare counter from black. The beginner is encouraged to go to the openings section on the palcorner cannon for more information.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]"As both sides were playing 'unorthodox' openings, there were no fixed formulas to adhere to. Both sides were arranging our pieces based on our intuition and knowledge." -- GM Zhang Guofeng[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]"During the game, I analysed that at this stage in the opening, I had not gained much advantage. If I were to choose to play less aggressively, black's speed of development of her chess pieces would be much faster than mine. Therefore, although I was not very willing, I chose to exchange chariots, hoping to be on the aggressive." -- GM Zhang. ||||Well, GM Zhang is well known for her fierce aggressive style of play! LOL.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]" No matter what happens, I could not allow my remaining chariot to be blocked off or contained. My game would be very passive should it happen! " --GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]" This move was a continuaion of my central cannon playe a few moves back. I thought that the best way to develop my horse was via the central file. " -- GM Zhang Guofeng[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]" For red to crack black's defenses from the center was a hard task. That is why another option for black would be to play R8+6 instead. " -- GM Zhang ||||Please click on the variation to see what GM Zhang suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]" At this stage in the game, I was in a predicament again. Black's defences were tight and solid, that is why the main reason for me pushing the central forward was NOT to attack but rather to allow my riverbank chariot more space to maneuver. " --- GM Zhang||||Ah, we learnt something again![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]" If I had played H5+7 to take the pawn" -- GM Zhang Guofeng ||||Please click on the variation to understand why GM Zhang did not play H5+7![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]"Black pushed her cannon forward to guard her pawn rank with the hope of playing C6=5. However, her right flank is relatively empty and would be a target for attack by red. In the course of the game, if I were black , I would have played P5+1..." -- GM Zhang...||Please click on the variation below to see what GM Zhang suggested![/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]" This move would disallow black's chariot from moving to her right flank. Of course I would not miss it!" -- GM Zhang Guofeng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]"And after my two horses are able to attack in a linked fashion, there is no way that black can offer protection of her right flank with the black chariot." -- GM Zhang Guofeng[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]"Important move! If black did not make this move, red would have played R7=4! and black would have a hard time countering the effects of this move." -- GM Zhang Guofeng[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]" After black's chariot had control of the 6th file, I could not find any target to attack for the moment, that is why I played the advisor for defense first, waiting to see what black had to offer!" -- GM Zhang Guofeng[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]"Black wanted to try to get her side horse into action, but if she played H9+8, she would be worried of red's C7=3 move! " -- GM Zhang||Please click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]"After a few rounds of a standoff, we reach the diagram given. Under these circumstances, I first thought about the fact of a lack of a significant advantage on my side. After all, black has a menacing central pawn. But I still felt that I had chance of winning this game, which is why I played  the following move ..." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]" After the pawn exchange, the red chariot would be pinning the the black side horse and I would have a new option of playing C5+5! (and capture the black side horse with R1+2 afterward).||If black continued to play H9+8..." -- GM Zhang Guofeng||Please click on the variation on the next move to see what GM Zhang had suggested.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]" I must admit that black's sacrifice of her elephant with this move was out of my expectations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]"If I had insisted on playing C5+5 ..." -- GM Zhang ||Please click on the variation below to understand why GM Zhang did NOT play C5+5 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]"This was a very good move from black! It gave black the option of playing C6+1 or C6+2 on the next move." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]"Black moved her 7th file cannon away, letting me believe that the black horse on the third file could be a target to attack. However, that file was very congested, which was why I decided to retreat my chariot backward to allow more space for my linked horses and cannon to maneuver. I would thus have the option of playig C7=4 on my next move"-- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]" Black's cannon on her 4th file was becoming a pain. If I were not to remove this roadblock, it would be hard for me to apply different tactics of attack." --GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]" The time limit was one and a half hours each. Black's time was running out at this stage in the game. That was why GM Ouyang was not able to think clearly for this move. As seen in this case, C4+4 would have been better for black, even though an exchange would still occur... " -- GM Zhang.||Please click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"After a series of exchanges, I finally realize my aim of attacking the black horse!" -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]"At this point in the game, black's time was runnning out and was unable to think clearly. H3-2 would have been better!" -- GM Zhang Guofeng[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment59]"If Red played C6=7 instead, black could have played H2-1 to escape being killed. By playing this move, not only is the black horse trapped, Red could go for a checkmate with C+=9 on the next move." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]"Although black was able to finish the number of required moves in the time limit set, black was unable to resolve red's C+=9 kill and decided to resign.." --GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]!||GM Zhang's suggested move for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]"If red chose to play H6+7 instead..." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_54]"And although red would still have the upperhand, black could still offer resistance." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]"And it would be an all out attacking game for both sides!" -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]"If I had insisted on playing C5+5 ..." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]"and at this stage, although I had gained an extra elephant, I would have lost both cannons, and my remaining chess pieces would not be much of a threat to black. That is why after some consideration, I deciede to retain my cannons and search for other alternatives instead."-- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_44]These were the moves that GM Zhang had suggested if black insisted on playing H9+8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_49]"... And after chasing the black cannon away, a hole in black's defense would appear." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_38]This was what might have happened if black played H9+8 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_42]For beginners, black cannot play E5-3 or red would simply checkmate with C3+3 for the smothered cannon checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]"At this stage in the game, red's chess pieces would be very active and unhindered." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_44]If black tried to continue with this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]!!! Ouch...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_47]"And red would have a fierce attack!" -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]GM Zhang's suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]"Black's chariot would be able to offer some protection in time to her right flank. " -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_38]"And it would turn into a chariotless endgame, whereby it would not be favourable to red." -- GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]Why this would not be suggested![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]" And black's chess pieces would be very active!" --GM Zhang[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]" ... at this point in the game, Black has sufficiently added back up to her right flank and after chasing away my 7th file cannon, black's chess pieces would be very lively. I would not be in control then. " -- GM Zhang ||||Indeed so![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_24]GM Zhang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]"And after capturing the lost material, black would be better off in playing the remaining chess pieces. " -- GM Zhang||||Indeed, the red chariot is more or less trapped and would take one or two moves to become functional again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]
