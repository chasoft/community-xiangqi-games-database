[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg Zhao Guorong W Cai Yi||A16 Elephant with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Right Proper Horse||||This game was played on 2011/11/23 between GM Zhao Guorong and Master Cai Yi. GM Zhao needs no introduction.||Master Cai Yi ?? (born in 1984) is of Manchurian descent and majored in Law in Beijing's university. Master Cai is one of the hottest players in the past 5 years with a very good winning percentage.||||It was the ninth round in the competition and both players had already ammassed 11 points. Although it would be impossible to win the tournament, a win here would enable a good placing while a loss would mean a very poor placing, thus affecting the rankings that year.||Commentary was provided by GM Wang Bin and this annotated game was found in the 12th Edition of the monthly Periodical Qiyi.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This is not a move that is often played. GM Zhao chooses to travel the less beaten path, and thus avoid any traps or flying daggers that Master Cai Yi would have prepared.||With this move, GM Zhao wants the game to proceed to the midgame stage early.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]So far the moves are ok.||GM Wang Bin feels that this cross river chariot move does not seem to too proactive. ||He suggests that red push the central pawn forward instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And it is a standoff at this stage with red maintaining the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]C2-2 would seem to a be a better move.||By playing C2-2, red's lame horse (H2+4) is still a target for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]and both sides exchange their major pieces in the last few moves...||The game has quickly progressed into midgame...[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And the game quickly simplifies into the endgame stage.||In the endgame, black has a horse which is more valuable than the cannon but it is undeveloped! ||Red also has more pawns and is already applying pressure to black's empty right flank. ||Advantage goes to red!||Black would have a hard time even trying for a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]GM Zhao shows his prowess with this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Not a very efficient move.||Post-game commentary suggests that black should play R8=5 to try to eliminate to try to offset red's pawn advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]GM Zhao does not rush his moves and answers patiently with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Nice move!||Black is in a dilemma now!||Red forces the black chariot away from the riverbank. If black accepts the challenge, the board would simplify into a sure-win situation for red!||The 3 red pawns alone would be sufficient to win black's full guard.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]GM Wang Bin suggest R2-1 as another possible option as black can follow up this move with R2=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]For unknown reasons, black opted to change his moves!||If he continued to harrass the central elephant with R2-1 and repeating with R2+1, it was ok by the rules and could very well have forced a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment79]GM Zhao chooses to play it safe by changing his defensive formation. However, P5+1 is a good option as red already has superior material advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]Black is forced to make this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment103]Red does not forget to prevent black's pawn from crossing the river![/DhtmlXQ_comment103]
[DhtmlXQ_comment125]And the final red pawn has crossed the river!!!||If H5-3, red would capture the horse with a discovered check with P5=4 followed by P4=3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment125]
[DhtmlXQ_comment147]And black resigns.||Red wins.[/DhtmlXQ_comment147]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_92]nope![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_97]and red would have successfully simplified the endgame to a surewin situation. It would be very hard for black to force a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_97]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_41]It would be inadvisable for red to take the central pawn now![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]And red has not charged the pawns forward. Black's chances for forcing a raw would be greatly increased![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]and red would not gain much in the exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]And red would be much better off!||Black's most apparent weakness is his empty right flank and this would be an obvious target of attack for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]And black has a clear target to attack: down the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
