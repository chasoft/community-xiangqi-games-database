[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120806 2008 jczyb Zhang Guofeng L Hu Ronghua||ECCO C78 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 1st,3rd Pawn Advancement and right riverbank horse variation.||ECCO:C78 ??????????????????||||This game was from one of my more recent books. In 2008, the first ever ????? ??????? was held in Shanghai. At that time, it was the competition with the highest prize money whereby the champion could win 30k Chinese Yuan...(wow...). There were 28 male participants and 4 female participants (the top 4 ranked players at that time). Jiang Chuan (who still had not made GM then) was the champion while Sun Yongzheng (who made GM in 2011) was runner up.||Commentary was provided by GM Jiang Chuan. ||||"The top four female GMs were allowed to participate in the compeition. An additional bonus to this competition was the participation of the legendary GM Hu Ronghua. That was because GM Hu became much less active in competition after the age of 60. Even competition of the caliber of the 5 Rams Cup were unable to entice him. ||The main reason for GM Hu participating in this competition was that the organizer, the CEO of ????? was his disciple and that the Shanghai Xiangqi Association was organizing the event. To help promote Xiangqi back in his hometown, GM Hu decided to participate again. ||And he did quite well. He won female GM Zhang Guofeng, and Master Wang Yang, and only lost in the quaterfinals to Master Huang Hailin. "||Jim: Well , you have it, one of the rare appearances of the GREAT ONE![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]In the actual competition, GM Zhang decided to take red and GM Hu obliged. Like a humble student, GM Zhang made her first move. ||Jim: it is always a learning experience playing against GM Hu...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]GM Hu chose to push the 3rd pawn forward first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]In this variation, black has the authority to decided whether to exchange the side pawns or not.  After the exchange, black gets to develop the side chariot which becomes very versatile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Some might play E7+5 before this move but the order of moves would not make too much of a difference.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]By offering an exchange of chariots, red hopes to be able to move H3+4 and thus capture black's central pawn for the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And this would be considered unorthodox play. Red tries to bring the game into uncharted waters. ||||Jim: Pls click on the variation to see the most commonly played moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]A straightforward no nonsense move![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]The red chariot has travelled far and wide before this exchange. It would be a relatively even game now.||The main concern in the game now is the slow pace of the development of the chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Red's chariot retreat is not advisable. It actually frees black's horse on the cannon rank. ||Jim: Pls click on the variation to see GM Jiang's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Red had hoped that black would play P7+1 on the next move whereby she could play R2=3. That way, she would have positional advantage.||But GM Hu had a surprise in store...[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36](GM Hu sees through red's intentions and suddenly offers a chariot exchange!)[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And GM Hu's moves in the endgame to come are a lesson worth learning for all of us![/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]!!!||Jim: Pls click on the variation to understand what would happen if black played E5+7 instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]!!! Another brilliant move!||This may not seem much, but the implications of this move for red are devastating![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]And red was forced to play this move or she would not have been able to develop her right horse with H3+4. ||Jim: Black would be threatening with a smothered cannon checkmate with C7+9![/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]And if you looked at the board now, red's pieces are in a disarray. There is not much of a defensive formation. Black has the pawn advantage too. The side red elephant would also be a majo cause of concern.||This shows that Black had already planned for this to happen![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Red was not able to find any efficent way of stopping this black horse for developing. That is why she decided to be proactive and played this move instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Red cannot play P3+1 now, or else black would simply play H4+3. Once this horse is able to join in the attack, red would be in deep trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Black prevents red from playing C5=3 for a sneak attack. He also allows his cannon to threaten the red pawn with C4-3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]Red hoped that black would move his horse away so that she could play C4=3 on the next move. But she never expected that GM Hu had another surprise in store!||P2=1 would have been a much more practical move![/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]And GM Hu made this move after much precise calculation. This move would thwart all of red's intentions the past few moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]Black now has two pawns ready to charge across the river while Red does not have any feasible counter. It was quite a predicament for red at this stage. ||Black, on the other hand, was prepared to take the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment70]Black had advanced his horse consecutively to make it so much more menacing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment70]
[DhtmlXQ_comment75]Red makes this stubborn play, hoping that if black played P5+1, she could force an exchange with C+-1 for the skewer. After an exchange of chess pieces, her hopes of a draw would be much higher![/DhtmlXQ_comment75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]This move would actually hasten Red's loss. However, in view of the menacing central black pawn, perhaps this was the best move available.[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]After the red advisor has been caught, red has no more chance.[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment94]Black prepares to play H7-6 (chasing the pesky riverbank cannon away) to allow his central pawn to cross the river.[/DhtmlXQ_comment94]
[DhtmlXQ_comment102]And black seizes the chance to push the central pawn across the river! The game enters the final stages ...||Jim: For beginners, if red played C1=5 to take that pawn, black would simply capture the cannon back again with a check (H6+4).[/DhtmlXQ_comment102]
[DhtmlXQ_comment106]This would effectively force the horse to bad positions and thus increase the efficiency of black's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment106]
[DhtmlXQ_comment108]GM Zhang had stubbornly tried to cling on but Black's domination of the game was too great a hurdle for her. No matter what she did, it was now impossible for her to force a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment108]
[DhtmlXQ_comment116]And black threatened to win with the horse cannon checkmate (C1=4). There was nothing that Red could do. Black won the game after red threw in the towel.||In this game, GM Hu shows his superb endgame skills and deep mastery of endgame principles.||Jim: Whew...I could not understand most of the moves until many many moves later. Looks like I had better quicken my endgame upload! ||PS: GM Hu came out of retirement and had a quick superb victory over another GM one or two months ago...There is a saying in Chinese ????...[/DhtmlXQ_comment116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_82]And black would still be very menacing. ||Red would still be in deep trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_40]This is not a good move![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_41]And black would not gain anything after the exchange. Red would now have an additional threat of the cross river red pawn.||In retrospect, only one with a thorough understanding of the game and appreciation of the positions of the chess pieces would be able to have played C9=7 on the previous move.That way, black would also have addressed the balance of the game too![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]And red could adopt a wait and see tactic to the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]And red would be able to pin the black horse and chariot temporarily.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
