[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120330 2006 cnxsc Xu Yinchuan W Wang Yang E37||ECCO: E37 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon variation vs Thundering Defense with Left Elephant Variation||ECCO:E37 ???????????????||||This was a game in the 2006 Chinese National Xiangqi Singles Competition. GM Xu Yinchuan wins the tournament again. His previous win was 5 years ago in 2006.||It was one of the highlight games of that year. GM Xu and Master Wang Yang had drawn their previous game of normal chess. This was a game of lightning chess for both.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]By playing the red side horse, red opts for a more stable formation, choosing to development his own side while seeking chances.||H2+3 would be another major variation.||In the mid 2010's playing C5+4 was another interesting variation which was becoming more popular with good results for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black would often play A4+5 as another option. ||Please click on the variation below to see it...[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]By using the central cannon to capture the side pawn, red gains a pawn but also loses the mighty central cannon. ||R1=2 was the move played in another game.||Please click on the moves to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]This was a fight for a place in the quaterfinals between two of the best players in the decade.||It was interesting to see that this formation was exactly the same as a previous game, which was a game of normal chess, unlike this game which was a game of lightning chess.||Red played R1=2 then, and the game ended in a draw.||Please click on the variation below to see the moves in that game!||Perhaps GM Xu went home and did his homework to come up with this move. ||Both players are well known for this sort of play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]GM Xu does not let his guard down!||R1=2 is not advisable now![/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]P3+1 to control this file would be a nice option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]At this stage in the game, it would seem to be a standoff for both sides. There does not seem to be much fighting going on but the tiniest of mistakes would be costly!||With this move, black tries to limit the development of the left red horse, but in retrospect, it actually  helps develop this horse and lets the red chariot occupy a very important position on the board, both defensively and offensively!!!||The commentator suggests that black play P7+1 or R2+6 instead. ||Please click on the variation to see why![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Good move!||GM Xu stirs up trouble with this move, attacking the black riverbank chariot, forcing a disruption in black's formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]The commetator suggested that K4+1 might have been better!||Hmm, beats me![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Perhaps going for an exchange and then playing H9+8 would be much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Black self destructs with this move. Perhaps it was because of time pressure in this lightning chess game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]And black resigned and he would be unable to overcome the huge material deficit. GM Xu would go for the elbow horse attack.||Although this was a game of lightning chess, GM Xu shows why he is regarded as one of the best if not the best for the past two decades.[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]Suggested move 1: P7+1[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]And both sides would be in a deadlock.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]And it would still be an even game for both sides![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]Nope! not now![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]And black would still be able hold on and fight![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]Suggested move 2: R2+6[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_33]And red would be slightly better off but black would still hold fort![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_20]And black would gain material![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]GM Xu Yinchuan D Master Wang Yang||1st game of normal chess in the round 3 of the same tournament.2006?�?????�.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]And both sides were tangled up, whereby the game eventually ended in a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]This was the move played in the 2003 National Xiangqi Singles Championships.||Red was Master Li Hongjia while black was Master Hong Zhi (who had not been promoted to GM yet)[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]And both sides would be at a standoff![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_10]Commonly played variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_11]These were the moves that were played in another game in the same year (2006). It was round 15 of the Qixin Golf Cup,�??????�?????????15?.||Red was GM Xu Yinchuan while black was GM Zhao Guorong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]R6=2 or R6=5 are also ok.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]And red would have increased his advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]
