[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120329 2006JiaotongJianshe Cup Dang Fei W Jiang Chuan C75||ECCO: C75 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with 1st and 3rd Pawn Advancement and Right Riverbank Horse Variation||ECCO:C75 ??????????????????||This was another file I found on the net. The game was commented by the winner himself, Master Dang Fei.||||In 2006, the "Jiaotong Jianshe Cup" "?????" was held in Ningbo Province.||As winning the tournament would allow some of the players to be promoted to the title of Grandmaster, this compeition practically attracted all the top Masters like Xie Jing, Sun Yongzheng, Jiang Chuan. ||The competition came to an end on 2006/12/18.||For the male division, Zhao Xinxin was crowned champion. Second to eighth places belonged to Huang Hailin, Xie Yeshi, Nie Tiewen, Xu Chao, Wang Yuefei, Jing Xueyi and Jin Bo respectively.||For the female section, Gang Qiuying won and was promoted to GM for achieving the winning percentage required. Second to eighth placins were  Tang Dan, Zhang Wentong, Mei Na, Zhang Tingting, Zhao Yan, Li Xian, Wen Jing.||I had just entered university and it was a whole new experience for me in Ningbo. Everyday was a new day. Every opponent presented with different challenges and lessons to be learnt. ||This was the game that I played against Master Jiang Chuan from Beijing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]After much consideration, I still chose to play the less volatile 3rd Pawn Advancement variation ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]H2+1, P1+1 and E3+5 are other commonly played variations. ||In 2006, E3+5 was especially popular and fashionable! ||Please click on the variation below...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]This is one of the more direct approach to the game.||R9=4 is another option. Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]This move to control the all important 6th file was first played by Master Wang Yang not too long ago. ||In the past, E3+5 was played, resulting in an even situation. ||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]A new variation!||Master Jiang Chuan comes into the match well prepared!||R1-2 is usually played!||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]R-=5 is not advisable![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]In actual play, I had considered moving P7+1 ..but after more analysis, I decided to play this move instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]I wanted to discourage black from moving H2-4 with this move. ||H2-4 would be a discovered attack on red's part![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]H1-3 is not advisable!||If Master Jiang insisted on playing H1-3, red would threaten with a fork with C6-4!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]At this stage in the game, Red is still slightly better off.||I had the extra central pawn with better positioning. ||I believe that this move was the cause of black's downfall.||R6+5 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]And I chose to be aggressive by going for black's pawns![/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment67]Post game analysis showed that this move was too simple and direct.||Black would not have dared to fork red's cannon with R8-3 as red would immediately checkmate with R3+3. ||P3+1 would have been more efficient and the red cannons would have won the game earlier.[/DhtmlXQ_comment67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment95]This was a very careless move on my part.||I should have played R8=1 to capture the black cannon! It was good fortune that I did not have to hand over my lead in the game with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment95]
[DhtmlXQ_comment96]Good move by Master Jiang!||When Master Jiang played this move, I felt the chills run through my spine. Time was running out for me now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment96]
[DhtmlXQ_comment99]I was forced to make this move.||Please click on the variation to understand why it would be a draw if red played C1-5 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment110]We were both under in time trouble now at this stage. All the moves were made after one or two minutes of thinking.||Perhaps Master Jiang wanted a win badly and chose not to capture my cross river pawn, hoping to find a chance to win.||Black's side pawn would not be too much of a threat. Although red would still have the clear advantage, it would be easier for black to force a draw. And as both players were in time trouble, anything could happen.||R9=6 would be the better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment110]
[DhtmlXQ_comment115]With this move, red allows the red king full control of the center and prevents black's pawn from advancing![/DhtmlXQ_comment115]
[DhtmlXQ_comment135]And red is prepared for the final kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment135]
[DhtmlXQ_comment137]After a series of maneuvers, red has now all his chess pieces ready for the kill. ||Perhaps Master Jiang was under too much time pressure to realize the gravity of his situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment137]
[DhtmlXQ_comment138]K5=4 would have been better. But red could still counter with R5=7!||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment138]
[DhtmlXQ_comment139]And black has no chance of escpae!||After playing this move, I heaved a huge sigh of relief. Master Jiang discovers my ploy and resigns swiftly. ||||The following moves were added for the beginner to understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment139]
[DhtmlXQ_comment141]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_141]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_138]A slightly better counter...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_138]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_139]![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_139]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_141]![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_147]And it would be a matter of time before black loses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_147]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_102]And the red central pawn would be eliminated.||The game would simplify to a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_102]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_68]Black cannot be tempted to make this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_69]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_48]Master Dang's suggestion...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]And although red would still have the advantage, black would still have a game going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_43]And red would gain material...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_35]This was what I had thought off...[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_39]![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_44]And although red has a mighty cross river pawn, red would not have sufficient firepower to carry through. ||It would be black's turn for offense.||That is why I deided to play R6+2 anyhow.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]Not advised....[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_35]Nice![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_36]Black cannot play R5+1 as red would simply play R8+6!||Click in the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_41]And red would still be slightly better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_37]And red would be much better off!||Black cannot take the chariot with C8=2 or red would checkmate with R2+9!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]Commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_33]And red would still be slightly better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_23]This was the move that was usually played![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_34]And it would be a relatively even game![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_19]Another commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_34]And both sides would be in a deadlock.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_14]One of the more popular variations in 2006.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_33]and red would still be slightly better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment14_33]
