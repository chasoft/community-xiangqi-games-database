[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120729 2nd BGN Wang Bin W Nie Tiewen C64||||ECCO:C64 57 Cannons vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement||ECCO:C64 ????????7?||This game is from one of my books, a commented game by GM Wang Bin in the 2nd BGN championships.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This variation is a favorite of Heilongjiang players. H3+2 would be another often played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]This H3+2 move is a rather new improvision.||P7+1 was the move that was played in the past.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]By restricting the movement of the horse, I tried to keep my options open and did not want the game to enter P3+1 variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]This is one of the more often played variation.||If black chose R2+6, red could consider H3+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Another often played variation which is a favorite of Heilongjiang players.||Other less often played variations are C1=3 and H3-5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]This is a continuation of the previous move that black played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And I surprised Master Nie with this flying dagger. ||To my knowledge, this variation had never been played before and it completely disrupted black's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]After much thought, Master Nie played this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Black had no other better choices.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]A simple and direct strategy.||With this move, red has more pawns and also destroyed an elephant, thereby weakening black's defense.||Black's pieces are congested and poorly positioned .||A win for red was imminent at this stage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]And black resigned.||With this win, I eliminated Master Nie and made it to the semifinals.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And the positioning of the red pieces would be much better, firmly grasping the lead in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]If red chose to play this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]And black's left chariot would be without a root or unprotected.||Red would have an easier time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]If red chose to play this move or C3=4...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]Black would have wasted one move and red would have gained an extra pawn to have significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]Usually played move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]And both sides would have their areas of concerns in the game to follow.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]And red would have the pawn advantage and more room to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]"Often played variation"[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]And the game would become rather even.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]And red could play R4-1 next, allowing red a big advantage. This variation is now seldom seen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]
