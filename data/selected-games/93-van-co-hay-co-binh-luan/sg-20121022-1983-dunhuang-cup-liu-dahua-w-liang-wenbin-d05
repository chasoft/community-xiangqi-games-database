[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121022 1983 DunHuang Cup Liu DaHua W Liang WenBin D05 ||||ECCO:D05 ?????????||ECCO D05 Same Direction Cannons: Ranked Chariot vs File chariot with riverbank chariot variation.||||Jim: This game was played back in 1983. It is a short but very exciting game. Playing red was GM Liu DaHua while black was Master Liang WenBing, who is well known as the Gold Medal Coach in China.||Both were in their heyday when this game was played: GM Liu having won the National Championships in 1980-1981, while Master Liang came in 3rd place in his first apperance in the same competion in 1977 and has obtained good results over the next few years.||This game was published in a recent edition of "Xiangqi" but unfortunately, the commentator was unknown. ||Master Huang ShaoLong had commented on this game also. Very nice variations were given by him.||The comments given without any name would belong to the magazine's. ||PS: Master Huang and Mastera Liang both tied for 3rd place in the 1977 CNSC...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Jim: GM Liu is well known for choosing to play the "mirror image" move on the board...that is playing C8=5 instead of C2=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And we have the basic formation of the sdc: ranked chariot vs filed chariot with riverbank chariot variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Master Huang: Both players had aggressive styles. Red chooses to play both proper horses for to push the game into an even more aggressive level.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Another possible option would A4+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Black may also consider playing C8+2.||Red could counter with C2=7 or C2=3, both of which  would lead to red being better.||Master Huang: At that time, there was still insuffficient study into this opening. Advanceing this move would to be black's disadvantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]As seen in the diagram, this elephant move is not advisable, as it 'loosened' black's formation. Today (2012), black would choose to play A6+5 instead...||Master Huang: This was an old variation. The results of this variation were not good. Although C5=4 can be considered, the results of that variation are also not ideal for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And this was the move that was played by GM Liu. It was quite an innovation in those days as it now allows red to play R1=2 and targets black's weakness on the board mericilessly. A very strategically oriented board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Master Huang: As seen from the diagram, black's only flaw is the side elephant, thereby causing much disharmony to his formation. This would become a fatal flaw later![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This cannon exchange is a very important move to make. Only with this move will the flaws in black's formation be revealed. It is also a continuation fo the strategy that GM Liu had planned after playing C2=5 on the previous move.||Master Huang: And Red exchanges the cannon in the nick of a time. This would exploit black's weakness of the side elephant as the center is now thin and prone to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Correct move to make!||Black cannot play H6+4 now...[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]For the past few moves, Red has offered exchanges while maneuvering chess pieces to the better positions on the board. ||With two consecutive charges of the central pawn, black's weak center is now under heavy attack.||At this point in the game, black is already in lots of trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And red plays the advisor. Kungfu chess from the GM. The GM has been eying black's side elephant for some time now. Playing this advisor would prevent a possible counter from red. ||Jim: Click on the variation to understand why...I searched throuhg my database. This exact same formation was also reached in 2005 when Chinese Taipei's Chen GuoXing won against China's GM Yu YouHua![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Master Huang: Not much is done with this move. Perhaps P5+1 would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And with this chariot exchange for the two horses, Red mounts his final attack. Red has calculated that a kill would be possible. Very in-depth analysis and sharp acumen of the game.||Master Huang: Red has already controlled the game. With this simple exchange, Red prepares for the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]And black resigned!!!||The final two moves that the GM played were brilliant.||Black is in a dilemma now. Red threatens to gain back lost material with H5+3. If black chose to exchange chariots, both black chariots would be lost and red would win anyway...||The following moves were provided by Master Huang ShaoLong to explain why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Master Huang: If black refused the exchange...[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Jim: Red would gain a pawn and prepare to play H5+7![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Jim:Threatening to capture the black cannon![/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]And black's chariot would be lost with this check.||That is why Master Liang chose to resign![/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]Jim: Game played in 1995 in the 7th Asian Cup. Chinese Taipei's Chen GuoXing won this match against China's GM Yu YouHua![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]Jim: This was Master Huang's move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]Master Huang: And black would still have a fighting chance in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]Jim: This was the actual move played when Chen GuoXing took on Yu Youhua...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_53]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_97]Jim: And Red won. I do not know red won by time-out or by a black resignation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_97]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]Jim: Say red played this move BEFORE playing A4+5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]And now black would threaten to capture the red chariot while at the same time starting to attack the bottom ranked elephant. ||There is no need for red to risk such a situation since he already has control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]And red would have a huge advantage!||Jim: Red would now threaten to capture the cannon, and the central elephant and the horse...Black's weaknesses in this formation would be fully exploited.||Master Huang has provided his variations of this same move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_35]Master Huang: And red threatens to checkmate (with R5+1). Black would be forced to exchange his chariot for red's central cannon. Red would be much better off in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]Master Huang explains why this would not be feasible also.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_39]Master Huang: And red would have a seething attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And black would still in the game.||Master Huang: Red would only have a minor advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_14]Modern day recommendation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]And black could be satisfied with the state of things.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]And the game would quickly become a standoff.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]Master Huang explains why C5=4 is also not feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_21]And red would exercise much control over the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]And red would slightly better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_21]And red would be much better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_13]Another plausible alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_17]And red would have the say in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_10]Another possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_19]And red would be slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_19]And red would be much better off in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_8]"A viable alternative"[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_16]And black would still be able to handle red's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_10]Another viable alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_12]And the game would become a to and fro game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_12]
