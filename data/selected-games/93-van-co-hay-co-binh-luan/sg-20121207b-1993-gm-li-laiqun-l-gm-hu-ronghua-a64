[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20121207b 1993 GM Li LaiQun L GM Hu RongHua A64||||ECCO:A64 ?????????||ECCO A64 Cross Palace Cannon with Filed Chariot vs  Left Central CAnnon.||||This file was found over the internet and the game was played in 30/12/1993. Red was GM Li LaiQun while black was GM Hu RongHua.||The event was the first ever (and I think last ever) competition dedicated to the cross palace cannon. Red must start the competition with the cpc. ||Two arch rivals, GM Li LaiQun took red against GM Hu RongHua in this battle.||Commentary seemed to be provided by GM Hu himself and seemed to came from one of Hu's books.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Other commonly played variations would be R2+6 or R2+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Correct move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Empty move! P7+1 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]I had the huge advantage in hand and should have chosen the easiest move.||By playing this move instead, I had made the game complex and red would have his chances of trying to come back.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]Because this was a game of lightning chess, time was not to red's favor and he made this fatal flaw.||Playing E7+9 now to defend first would be better as red could still fight on. The outcome would not be determined yet.[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment63]And black is one chariot up, while red ran out of time and lost.[/DhtmlXQ_comment63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]And I would surely gain material and be sure to win instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]And red could play C9-1 on the next win to firmly hold the lead in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
