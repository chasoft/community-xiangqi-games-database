[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120506 1977 cnyxqc GM Yu Youhua L GM Lv Qin C49||ECCO: 49 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense with Edge Cannon for chariot exchange variation||ECCO:C49 ?????????????????||||This was another file I found on the internet. I think it can be downloaded at the Xq website in Malaysia. ||This game was played by GM Yu Youhua taking red against GM Lv Qin way back in 1978, in the Chinese National Youth Xiangqi Championships. It is one of the major battles that Lv won that started him on his way to becoming one of the greatest of all time. The comments were allegedly given by GM Lv Qin himself which are given in quotations.||Both Yu and Lv went on to become National Champions but there had barely started their glorious xq paths yet...||We take a peek into one of the greatest Xq minds...||"The 1978 National Youth Championships was held from the 4th to the 16th of August at Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. I was 16 that year and it was the first time I took part in a competition of national caliber. The men's section was divided into two sections and this game was played in the second round of the finals. I played black against Yu Youhua, who was the champion of the previous tournament last year."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]" I chose to push the 7th pawn forward first. At that time, doing so was quite fashionable and more and more people were playing this move so that the opening could be slowly directed into the opening that I had prepared. ||If I had played H2+3 instead, red could have played P3+1 or H8+9 for other variations..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]For beginners, this is the basic formation of the ECCO C49. Red has the central cannon, pushed the 7th pawn forward and a pawn ranked chariot. ||Black on the other hand has the screen horse defense. By playing H8+9 followed by this move, black goes for the edge cannon for chariot exchange variation, one of the most commonly played openings in the world.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]For beginners, this is one of the more aggressive counters that red can have: the central pawn advancement variation. Very fierce, very complementary to Yu's fierce attacking style.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]"Amongst the many variations of the central cannon vs screen horse defense, red's rapid  central pawn  advancement variation and black's edge cannon for chariot exchange variation are both complementary and the exact opposites of each other. After years of study, there have been many many new variations for attack and defense. ||In the 60's, red's C8=7 was one of the more direct and aggressive variations. Black would counter just as aggressively and there were many variations whereby black could launce a powerful counter. There are even more options for red to choose from nowadays (which would mean the time that GM Lv commented on this game, approximately in the 90's) . P5+1 is another variation..."||||Please click on the variation below to understand what GM Lv suggested...[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]For beginners, this is one of the main purposes of the throat ranked cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"Red's chariot in his pawn rank is considered to be one of the more aggressive variations of this opening. Yu also demonstrates his aggressiveness with this move (GM Yu is super well known for his very very very aggressive style of play!) . ||In the previous year (1977), in the National Xq Singles Championships, GM Wang Jialiang used this aggressive variation against GM Hu Ronghua and won. "||||Please click on the variation to see the game between GM Wang and GM Hu.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]" Developing the right black chariot is considered an essential move. H8+7 is another alternative..."||Please click on the variation below to understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]" If red chose to play R9=2... it would be a calm and peaceful game.."[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]"If red insisted on sacrificing the central pawn, R9=2 would have been a better and more effective play. Although black would have a central cannon, study of this opening still shows that red would still be to hold on to the lead. ||Playing P7+1 would also sacrifice the central pawn and would seem to be a less effective move. Not only does red gain nothing, it actually places himself in a predicament. I believe that red's downfall started with this move..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]"No matter what red was thinking of, he should have played R4+3 to prevent the cannon from traversing the board. Allowing this cannon to traverse the board would concentrate black's forces on red's right flank, placing red in peril! "[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]"Black focuses on red's weak right elephant and attacks mercilessly. Through a series of maneuvers, black has increased his control of the game. By pushing the central pawn across the river now, black has further increased his lead. Red is in all sorts of trouble now. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]"After some consideration, I decided to play this move for a chariot exchange. It was a simple and effective play that basically sealed black's fate. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment62]"In the last stages of the game, although Red was  down material wise, red still fought hard. Luckily , Black countered each attack with precision and eliminated all of Red's threats. ||With this forced exchange, black would be even down both material and positional wise. ||Black resigned at this move.||After defeating the defending champion, my confidence grew by leaps and bounds. After 6 rounds of competition, I managed 4W2D and collected my very first National Champion trophy.||It was a very important win in my career and was instrumental in pushing my game to new heights. "||||Jim's afterthoughts: heck, I could never play like this even at age 66, much less 16. Looks like I had better stick to translating more boards for the site...[/DhtmlXQ_comment62]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]1977 GM Wang Jialiang vs GM Hu Ronghua...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]"And red gained both material and position."||||Game played in 1977 by GM Wang Jialiang vs GM Hu Ronghua.||GM Wang went on to win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]"And after the chariot exchange, it would be a drawish game..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]Another not so good variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]" And it would be to red's advantage in this game..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]"And this opening could be accepted by both sides..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
