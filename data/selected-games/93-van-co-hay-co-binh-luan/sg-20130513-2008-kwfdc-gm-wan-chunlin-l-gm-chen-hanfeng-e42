[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130513 2008 kwfdc GM Wan ChunLin L GM Chen HanFeng E42||???||ECCO:E42 ???????||ECCO:E42 Pawn with Right Proper Horse vs Pawn with Right Proper Horse.||Jim: Another rather recent game from one of my books, <<????>> by GM ?? Jiang Chuan. A GM vs GM match. Commentary was by GM Jiang Chuan.||This was one of the game in the 2008 KaiWei Real Estate XiangQi Masters Cup, one of the biggest events in XiangQi nowadays. Unlike traditional competition, it adopted a 3-1-0 scoring system, whereby a win was given 3 points, instead of the traditional 2 points; a draw 1 point and 0 points for a loss. ShangHai's Xie Jing won that competition after defeating BeiJing's famed Xq Master Zhang Qiang in the last round and was successfully promoted to GrandMaster, making him of the youngest grandmasters ever.||||Jiang: Chen HanFeng, ZheJiang native. Born in 1978. In 2007 in NingBo, ZheJiang, local player Chen HanFeng performed brilliantly to win the National XiangQi Masters Competition, and achieved a winning percentage of 76% , thereby obtaining the status of GrandMaster.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And after some action, it becomes a central cannon vs screen horse defense game.||Playing the horse to the 8th file is one of the older approaches to the game. Current opinion suggests that this would result in black having to play R9=6 for development. The fate of this chariot would weigh heavily on the outcome of the game and would usually be a big problem for black; and that is why, although it was once very popular, this variation has slowly gone out of favor.||But Chen was known for his versatility on the board unconventional play. Perhaps that was why he chose this variation.||Another reason why Chen had chosen this counter might have been that he did not want to play R9=8 as red would have easily played the Ranked Chariot and 7th Filed Horse variation (?????), where Red was famed for.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]E3+5 is usually played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And red makes the first move.||By advancing the cannon to the cross-riverbank, red tries to lift black's barricade of his right chariot. This move has singlehandedly led the game into unchartered waters.||C8=7 is an option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]This would seem to be over-passive and would negate the effects of red's H7+6 earlier on. It would also have thrown the game into chaos.||A more aggressive suggestion would be C5+4.?[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Red chose to play steadfastly with this move, after considering the fact that black had managed to put up a very solid defense.||However, it would seem to be an inappropriate use of tactics and the outlook would seem bleak.||In reality, red's cannon on the cross riverbank was prone to attack. Making this move would allow red to resolve this issue and would be a better move than R2+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And black counters with a no-nonsense move, forcing red to show his intentions with his riverbank horse.||This move would also allow black to increase the threat of his pawn on the 7th file. ||Black has slowly deleted red's advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red chose to play this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]At this point in time, black has succeeded in obtaining a very stable and staunch formation, and was poised to start a counter-attack.||Red has lost his lead in the game.||It can also be seen that in actual play, in this match in the first round, black's psyche was staunch and chose control over volatility. He chose variations where he could have more control. ||In retrospect, playing P7+1 for the first move  would seem to be a nice strategy.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red is faced with a dilemma.||With this advisor move, black is allowed to position his cannon on red's bottom rank and red would have to pay dearly for that.||However, playing R9=8 would have equally dire consequences.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]R2=7 would not seem to be viable either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]At this stage in the game, black's riverbank chariot is poised to attack along the rib file (R2=4). It is a very tense moment for red now.||Red would have wanted to play R9+2 but was concerned with the fact that black could counter with C2-2 to block the red chariot and to attack the central elephant at the same time.||Black would also threaten to checkmate with the angler horse checkmate after C2=5!||That is why, after much consideration, red decided to try for C3+1 and hopefully R2=7 to save himself. ||However, it would seem to be too late.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]And this would cost red dearly.||R9+2 would still have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]A5+4 and P7+1 are not viable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Red has lost his advisors, and now he would have to face the threat of P7+1.||Red is having a very hard time trying to defend indeed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]Red's attack along the center is too weak to be of any threat to black.||In contrast, black has successfully organized his 2r1h1c combination for the final blow.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Jim: Nice!||For beginners, red cannot play K5=4, or black would checkmate with H2+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]And red resigned.||Black had managed to organize his 2r1h1c material into a nice kill.||Black won this one.   ||Jim: For beginners, black is now threatening to mate with C1-1. If red tried to counter with R++6, black would simply defend with A5-6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_40]And black would not be far from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]If red tried to exchange chariots...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]And black would also not be far from victory...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]Still a better move than C3-1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]Jim: I added this variation to show what GM Jiang meant by red trying to save himself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_44]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]Jim: I added this variation for beginners...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]And red would still lose.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_44]And red would have to sacrifice more material to avoid being killed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]Best defensive move by GM Jiang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_39]And this would increase the difficulty of red trying to win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]And no matter how red tried to exchange material, it would seem inevitable that red's advisors would be lost![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_42]And after the sacrifice, black would have an attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_32]And red would be prepared to charge his pawn on the 7th file across the river.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]Or black would threaten to gain material with R6=2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]And after the exchange, black can be very satisfied with the outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_24]And things would look good also for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_28]And black would have now wrestled control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]Or E3+5 would also be ok.||At least red would have retained a central cannon and also have gained a central pawn in the process.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_29]And it would still be a long game ahead, as neither side would have the clear advantage.||This were the actual moves played in 2007, during an A League whereby GM Tao HanMing took red against GM Zhao XinXin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_13]This is another possible option with its own rules for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_10]NO!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment15_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_16]And red would be in control as red would be significantly faster in developing all his important material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_16]
