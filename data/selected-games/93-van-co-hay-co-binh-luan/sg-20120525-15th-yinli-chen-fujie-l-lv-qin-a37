[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120525 15th Yinli Chen Fujie L Lv Qin||ECCO A37 Elephant with left proper horse vs 7th Pawn Advancement.||ECCO:A37 ???????7?||||This game was played more recently in 2004 in the 15th Yinli Cup between Chen Fujie and Lv Qin, both from Guangdong. ||Commentary was provided by GM Zhuang Yuting ???.||||"On 2004/3/23,the 15th Yinli Cup began in Chengdu. ||Male participants inclucded Lv Qin??, Wan Chunlin???, Wang Bin??, Xu Yinchuan???, Xu Tianhong???, Miao Yongpeng???, Chen Fujie???, Liu Dahua??? and Xie Kui??. ||Female participants included Dang Guolei???,Wang Linna???,Zhang Guofeng????Hu Ming???Wen Jing???Guo Liping????Gang Qiuying????Zhao Dong???Zhao Yan??.||When the tournament ended, Lv Qin and Wang Linna beat runners up Xu Yinchuan and Wen Jing to become the male and female champions respectively."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]"In the opening stages of the game, both players opted for stable development of their chess pieces and soon, all the chariots were exchanged. The game thus progressed to a horse cannon endgame. Although it was a drawish game, neither sides wanted to give up and each player sacrificed an elephant to continue the brawl.||Finally, GM Lv Qin made full use of a insignificant mistake by Chen and proceeded to win with a very exciting combination. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]"Pushing the pawn forward to counter the elephant has been increasingly popular over the past few years. GM Lv Qin liked this counter exceptionally. C8=6, C2=4 are also often played counters."[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]"Both players were from Guangdong and knew each other well. By exchanging the chariots, the game would be more of test of pure skill for both sides as there would be less chances to fall into pre-set traps. Chen preferred this sort of chess and Lv could also accept. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]"At this stage, Chen plays the ranked chariot also. This is a very interesting play from Chen.||For players who would prefer a more balanced game, A4+5 could be an alternative."[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]"Black advances his chariots twice along the same file. It would seem to be a waste of moves but in fact, it is a brilliantly disguised move. If black had immediately played R6+5 on the previous move, red would have played H7+6 immediately, thereby allowing red control of the riverbank. By pushing R6+3 first, red is tempted to play the riverbank cannon, therefore, allowing black to play H7+6 after this move! This shows the unique thinking of tactics of GM Lv."[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]"At this stage, the chances of red winning the game seem minimal. At this stage, red should have played C9-1 followed by C9=4 to chase away the horse to ensure a draw."[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]"GM Lv taunted Chen with his previous move. And the young Chen was unable to hold his cool as seen in this move. ||Should red have chosen to play more for a draw, H6+8 would have been preferred! "||Pls click on the variations given by GM Zhuang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]"By moving the horse toward the sidelines, red has chosen a wrong direction to attack. Red should have played H3+5+ and then try to go back to defend. It would not be that bad a state of things!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]"Chen was under time pressure when he made this blunder! Chen must have thought that black was going to play H3+1 for the attack, so he decided to play this move. Should Red continue with H3+1. he could try to play H4-2 for the exchange. But Chen forgot or did not see that Lv could play C9-3. A better move might have been C1=7 to defend!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]"Seeing that black was about to go in for the kill, red is forced to play the cannon to try to help defend...And there goes his attack on black!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]"On the board, black's horses have been terrorizingred. Black's C5-2 may not seem much , but it actually harbors many deadly intentions!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment98]"And black wins after red resigns!||A lesson to be learnt from this game: when faced again a top notch opponent, any minor detailed cannot be overlooked. If there was no chance to win, going for a draw would be the best way out!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment98]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]"Preferred move to go for a draw!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_43]"And after red captures the central pawn, a draw would be very possible!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]A more balanced play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]"And black can be satisfied with this outcome."[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
