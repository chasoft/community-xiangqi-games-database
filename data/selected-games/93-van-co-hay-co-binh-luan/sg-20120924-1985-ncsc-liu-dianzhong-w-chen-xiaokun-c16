[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120924 1985 ncsc Liu Dianzhong W Chen Xiaokun C16||ECCO: C16 Central cannon with riverbank cannon vs Screen Horse Defense.||ECCO:C16 ????????? ||||Tis game was played in round 7 of the 1985 Chinese National Singles Championships. The attacking moves in the final stage were quite exciting, and had an element of composed endgames. ||Jim:Very exciting game![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And the basic opening was now determined.||Red has used the Central Cannon with riverbank chariot variation while black has chosen the Screen Horse Defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement Variation.||Red's riverbank chariot allows red to have a more steadfast game.||C8=7, P3+1 and R9+1 are other viable options for red.||  ||||Jim: The name of the opening by the GM is named so. It is quite different from the ECCO system that came later.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]With this move, black aims to prevent red from playing P7+1.||Another option would be to play P7+1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black plays the side cannnon so that he has the option of playing R1+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This move was controversial. In retrospect, it might be the cause of black's demise.||Perhaps C1+4 followed by R1+3 would have been a better option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This was another rather reckless move. Black's right horse was pinned and black would have a hard time trying to organize a counter. R2=4 to control the rib files might have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Correct move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]With this move, the entire game becomes much more complex![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]H3+1 was not advised.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]A must make move! Blacks central cannon may look menacing but black does not have any other supporting material to help out.||Red has the material advantage and has the game under control.?[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Black is forced to make this move.||If the red horse was not captured, red would play H7-9 for the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]By retreating the horse, red now has a checkmate option of C9+3.||A better move would have been to play C9=3 to pin the black horse. Red would have control of the game firmly in hand. Unfortunately, I was not able to have detected that move as I was carried away with my original game plan.||This is a mistake that all players should be wary off. Never be too engrossed with your original game plan that you fail to notice other opportunities that present themselves.||One must always play the game according to the circumstances that present themselves and never be  carried away by irrational results. This is one of the fatal flaws in actual play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]And black goes on the offensive with a cannon sacrifice! Vicous![/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]H5+7 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]R4-5 to capture the horse would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]And red countersacrifices a chariot! brilliant![/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment58]Black has to make this move out of desperation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment79]Red wins. There is no way that black can resolve red's R4=6 checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment79]
[DhtmlXQ_comment85]There is no way that black can escape now.||Red wins the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment85]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]C9=6 would be substituted for this move with similar results.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_61]And red would gain back the lost chariot.||Red would not be far away from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]And this game would be far from over. ||Red has the material advantage but black has a faster attack. The pawns would be a deciding factor too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_58]And black would regain a lost piece with an easier game to play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_43]Jim: the following variations were found from the net. GM Liu did not give a reason why C9=3 would have allowed him a commanding hold of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_57]Tiger silhouette checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_51]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]And black would have absolutely no attack left whatsoever.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_40]Black would haves an attack that would be hard to quell.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_36]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]Although black would not lose material, black would still be on the receiving end of things.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_31]Red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_29]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment11_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_25]Not advised![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_28]And red would have lost the lead that he had built up.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_28]
