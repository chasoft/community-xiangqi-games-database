[DhtmlXQ_comment21]With this move, Sun keeps things complicated.||If he chose R4+3 instead, it would simplify things.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Black has an option of A6+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Correct move![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Post game analysis identified this move as the reason for Lv's loss.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Good move!||Red sacrifices before gaining the material back.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]It was suggested by Master Ge that black played C4=6 to adjust his formation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]This was not so good a move as compared to to C-=7... as suggested by Master Ge[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]H3+5 would seem to be a better alternative, as suggested by post game analysis.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]At this stage, red has the obvious advantage but as the pawns have not crossed the river, the road to victory is still long and arduous.||With this move, red attempts to sacrifice this pawn to clear the path for the red horse to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]It was suggested that black played A5+6 instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment111]With the elephant removed, red is not far from a win![/DhtmlXQ_comment111]
[DhtmlXQ_comment121]And the game has now simplified to a sure win endgame for red:||1r1h1hp2a2e sw 1r1c2a.[/DhtmlXQ_comment121]
[DhtmlXQ_comment159]Red wins![/DhtmlXQ_comment159]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_61]not advisable now![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]And it would be a draw!!!||That is why red played P5+1 for move 31...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_59]and red would still firmly have the upperhand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_47]This was the move suggested by Master Ge...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_55]and red would have the advantage.||Black is one elephant down defensively and two pawns down offensively.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]This seems to be a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_46]and black would still have a fighting chance.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]This variation was also played in 2011.||Red was Beijing's Master Wang Tianyi while black was GM Zhao Guorong. That game ended in a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]

[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]This variation was played in 2011, round 1, whereby red's GM Xu Yinchuan W GM Zhao Guorong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]

[DhtmlXQ_comment9_33]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]This variation was played in 2009 in the Chinese National Mind Games, round 5, GM Jiang Chuan D GM Wan Chunlin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_30]threatening a double chariot fork with H5+7[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_48]And black suddenly has the initiative!||The game ended in a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_22]This variation was played also in 2011.||Red was GM Liu Dahua who won against black's GM Zhao Guorong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_31]And red has the upper hand. ||GM Liu won that game against GM Zhao.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_31]
