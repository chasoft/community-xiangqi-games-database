[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120702 2006 A League Song Guoqiang W Miao Yongpeng A60||||ECCO:A60 ????||ECCO: A60 Cross Palace Cannon||Another board found from the internet. ||Master Song Guoqiang goes up against GM Miao Yongpeng in this A league match played back in 2006. ||Commetary was given by Master Song himself[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]"This game was played in one of the A league matches in 2006, in round 18. Black's cannon move is very unorthodox and does not conform with opening principles. ||One of the basic tenets in opening theory is that the cannon should not be advanced without any back up. R9=9 would have been better. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]"With this move, I prevent black from playing C7=3 and thus disallow him from adjusting his position.  This would not have been possible if I chose to play H8+9 or A4+5, as it is often played. By advancing this pawn, it also gives me much choice to maneuver my pieces according to the needs of the game."[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]"Black has a specific plan in mind by advancing this cannon. This is evident when he did not choose to play C2=7..."||Please click on the variation below to understand Master Song's analysis...[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]"This would have been better than playing A4+5..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]"Black tries another innovative move! "||Click on the variation below to see what might have happened if black chose R1=2 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]"In retrospect, this was not an efficent move. R1+1 would have been more target specific. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]"To prevent black from playing R1=2, this is a must make move. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]"And black can be satisfied with his opening after a series of brilliant maneuvers in this game."||Jim: Black is after all a GM! But one of the criticisms that the cross palace cannon has is shown in this game. If development of the chess pieces are not fast enough, red would actually slow the speed of the chess pieces and it would be  a congested mess...[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]"Faced with my cannon nuisance, this move that black has played would seem a little bit too nonchalant. Perhaps a better move would have been R1-1 ..."||Pls click on the variation to understand Master Song's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]"Under immense pressure from black, there was no way out. So I decided to give everything I had!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]"Red is not afraid of black playing R5+1.For if he did..."||Click on the variation below to see what might have happened..[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]"As seen in this game, black makes another rash move by pushing the horse forward. Perhaps he had been too confident of his situation, and did not see the flaws in his defense! C4=2 to simplify the game would be encouraged now for black!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]"Red decides to sacrifice for momentum! With this sacrifice, Red would apply pressure on black from both sides of the board. Black would have a hard time defending now!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]"Another poor choice! C2-4 would have been better!" ||Click on the variation to understand Master Song's recommendations![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]"Red should have played C2=6! This way, red's advantage would have been more evident!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment77]"With victory in sight, I lost my cool and played inefficiently. R1=5 would have been a simpe move to ensure a win!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment77]
[DhtmlXQ_comment84]"Using the pawn to exchange for 2 elephants was rash for me. A better move would be H4+2 which would have allowed me more versatility in the game!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment84]
[DhtmlXQ_comment97]"And both sides have reached a predicament whereby all the major chess pieces were more or less immobile. The speed of the pawns was the crucial factor in the game now!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment97]
[DhtmlXQ_comment111]"Red is forced to retreat the horse to try to attack instead of defend passively as the threat of the pawns could have been too much to handle!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment111]
[DhtmlXQ_comment116]"And this was the move that cost black the game. Black tried to go for the kill with this move. A better move would be P4+1 to capture the advisor..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment136]Jim: As black's cannon had moved to the 1st file, black is unable to play P4+1 now... As seen from the repeated checks, black was under time pressure.[/DhtmlXQ_comment136]
[DhtmlXQ_comment141]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment141]
[DhtmlXQ_comment143]Red wins!||For beginners, black could only reply with K5=4 for which red would checkmate with R1=4![/DhtmlXQ_comment143]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_116]Master Song's analysis[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_116]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_120]"And black would be on the winning end! "||Jim: For beginners, black has a checkmate with P4+1 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_120]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_121]For beginners...this move was made to prevent black's P4+1 checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_121]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_122]And this would also be a checkmate!||The cannons on the baseline win the day for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_122]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]Master Song's recommended move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]"And this outcome would have been better than the actual game itself for black. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_47]"And black's empty left flank would be at the mercy of red's concentrated forces!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_48]"And although black would still lag behind, the game would be still far from over."||Jim: Yeah, and black still has 5 pawns now![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_41]Jim: To go for the throat cutting checkmate (R8=5 followed by R2=4![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]"And red would not only have gained back lost material, red would also have a huge lead in the game with a powerful attack going on!"||Jim: The grave consequences of Black's H3-1 move are evident now!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]And black would have P3+1 AND R6=4 and very violent countermeasures..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]"And at this point in the game, black would have reclaimed the lead and have the advantage!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]"I should have played this move..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]"And red would have claimed the lead in the game much easier..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]"And red would have been much better off!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_13]Not advisable...[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]"And black could be satisfied with the state of things!"[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_8]"Should black have chose to play this move instead..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_11]"And red would have increased his lead with the better development of the chess pieces in this game. "[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_11]
