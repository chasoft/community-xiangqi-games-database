[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20130517 1990cntc Huang BaoCong L Liu Dianzhong C22||ECCO:C22 ???????????????||ECCO:C22 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot with 7th Filed Horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double Headed Snake Pawn Formation||||Jim: This game was played back in 1990, in the National Team Championships. GuangDong's Huang BaoCong took on HeBei's GM Liu DianZhong.||Comments were provided by GM Liu DianZhong himself. Nice sacrificial play and a brilliant example of positional over material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And the basic opening and counter is set.||Red has chosen the Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot while black had chosen to counter with the Screen Horse Defense with double headed snake pawn formation (pushing the 3rd and 7th pawn forward).[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Modern day XiangQi players usually advocate playing P3+1 or P7+1 to exchange pawns before moving R9=6. ||Black had made pushed the advisor out of habit. It would seem in retrospect to be too rigid.||As red had not pushed his pawns for an exchange, black could have considered H7+6 or C8=9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Retreating the cannon now would seem too early.||P3+1 should be played first. Usually, black would respond with C2+1. Red would then play C8-1 as when black's cannon is at the riverbank, red's C8-1 would have a target to attack .[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And since red had played C8-1, this would be a must make move ![/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]!!!||Black sacrifices material for tempo!||This is a key move to wrestle control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And black offers another exchange.||After the exchange, it would be a chariot vs no-chariot endgame.||Although black would still be down material wise, the cross river pawn would more than make up for his losses and black would have the commanding lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Exchanging cannons would allow black to retain the central pawn.||C5=1 would also be to black's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]With the pawns, black has controlled and severely limited the movement of the red horses.||The pawns are now prepared to charge forward.||Although, red has three major pieces, they are non-functional.[/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment78]And red resigned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment78]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]And black regains lost material. In the process of doing so, black has also increased his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]And black would also have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]And black would be better off positional wise.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]This would be a grave mistake.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]And red would be sure to lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
