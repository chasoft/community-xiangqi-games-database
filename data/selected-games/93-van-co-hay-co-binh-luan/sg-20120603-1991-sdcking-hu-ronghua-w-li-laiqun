[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120603 1991 sdcking Hu Ronghua W Li Laiqun||ECCO D11 Same Direction Cannons: Filed chariot vs slow chariot||ECCO:D11 ????????||||In 1991, an unusual competition was held. It was called the Baoren Cup Xiangqi World Same Direction Cannons competition. Players from all over the world were invited to take part. There was a catch, both red and black were only allowed to play the same direction cannons for the first move.||The competition was held in Kunming China. GM Hu Ronghua eventually won the tournament, making him the first ever and last (no future such tournaments were held) Same Direction Cannons King of the World.||The biggest obstacle to his crowning of the championship was GM Li Laiqun. They met in round 4 in this short but very exciting game held on 17th of Sept 1991.||It was obvious that whoever won this game would have a big chance of claiming one of the most interesting titles in the history of Xiangqi. ||I found this board on the internet. Unfortunately, it was not known who had commented on this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red H8+9 was a relatively fashionable variation way back then, 20 years ago. In the 70-80's the proper horses were the rage. ||By playing P7+1, black chose the slow variation or deferred variation as some might prefer to call it. Normally, black would play H2+3 but GM Li decides to play the ranked chariot, in the hope of bringing the game to relatively unchartered waters.||Just from the first 4 moves, we can see how important this game was to both GMs.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And this move from red to attack the pawn rank is also seldomly seen. GM Hu shows his creativity in this one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black tries to gain some initiative with this move. However, R1+1 would have been better as in the ancient manuals, this move of black was frowned upon. ||Playing R1+1 would give black a more balanced game as his central cannon be moved away if need be.||Playing C5=7 is not healthy for black now. ||Click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Correct move for black.  ||Black has to remove or decreased the threat of this red chariot. Black would lose quickly if he played H3-5 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Nice move!!!||Black is prevented from defending the advisor so that red can go for the kill with K5=4 quickly![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]In retrospect, this was the move that lost the game for black. C4+1 is the suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Red pounces on black's mistake and attacks ferociously by advancing the chariot and playing the king. Black is in deep trouble.||An interesting thing to note about this game is that after so many moves, all 32 chess pieces are still on the board, which is quite rare indeed!||Black has choked his own king with the centroid (WXF term which refers to the position where the black central horse is). This would become a deciding factor in the game. Black's king and advisors are immobilized and thus made a sitting duck. ||Red does not worry about the possible attacks that  black might have using his cannon on his chariots and adamantly plays his king to join in the attack. The reason for this is that he has been aiming to attack from the center for a long time![/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Another interesting point to note about this game is that red only made his first pawn move after 21 moves. This is another very very rare situation. ||Red plays his pawn now to chase away the black chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]And black resigns.||All of black's chess pieces are pinned by Red.||Red threatens with a checkmate with C-+3 which would force black to defend with R2+2. ||The black cannon and chariot are also pinned by the red chariot. Black cannot afford to exchange the cannon for the horse with R6=7 or else red would simply win with the iron bolt checkmate!||Black simply does not have any other chess piece to move!||Red on the other hand can charge his pawn forward, or even his two horses, at his own pace for the final win.||Very interesting game![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]And red would prepare to play C5+4 for an all out attack on black's center![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]And after the exchange, red would still be in the lead but black would still be able to hang on. It would still be too early for the game to be decided.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]Not advisable now![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]And red would be on the winning side after he plays K5=4 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]And red wins!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]And red would have control of the game. Black would be in a dilemma as if he played A4+5 red would play R++2. If he did not defend, red would have a threat attacking the advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]
