[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120727 2006 Kaiwei Real Estate Cup Lv Qin L Yang Deqi A43||ECCO : A43 Horse Opening with Palcorner Cannon Variation vs 7th Pawn Advancement||ECCO:A43 ????????7?||||Another board found on the internet. ||The commetator of the game was the winner of this game itself, Master Yang Deqi.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]This was the 5th ever Kaiwei Real Estate Cup Masters Rankings competition, round 1. It was also one of the more exciting games.||Under most circumstances, red would play P3+1 and black would answer with C8=7. This would be another very complex variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black pushes the pawn foward to target and slow the development of the red horses.||Although this would slow the development of the other chess pieces, the red horses would need some time be be developed. Give and take, it would still be an acceptable alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black plays the side cannon first to announce his intentions of preparing to capture the red cannon, thereby forcing it to be fixed in position. Once the cannon's position is fixed, red's formation would be thus disrupted and the poor development of the right red horse would become more apparent.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]It would seem that black would lose a one move initiative with this move but it would add increased pressure on red's right horse.||If red were allowed to push P3+1 to exchange pawns, red have an easy time in the game to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Although red tries to prevent black's H7+5 with this move, he also causes instability and undermines his own formation and flaws in his defense are revealed.||A more steadfast move would be A6+5..||Please click on the variation to understand Master Yang's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Black retreats his cannon to target red's left horse, in response to red's C6+4. This is a good selection of a target to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Red cannot play H8+7 now...||Click on the variation to understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]With this pawn sacrifice to  charge the horse forward, black has finally managed to concentrate his forces. The time is ripe for retaliation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]As seen on the board, black has prepared well for a retaliation. Black pushes the chariot forward to prepare to threaten the left red horse and cannon. A fierce attack is about to ensue.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]This is the simpler move.||H6-4 is another option. ||Pls click on the variation to see Master Yang's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]Correct move to play.||Black saves his own horse with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Black attacks the advisor with this simple move. K5=4 is another feasible option now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]C-+7 is suicidal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]C7=6 would not do much for red either![/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment72]As seen from the board, red retreats his cannon in the hope of finding positions to attack and hopefully save himself.||By retreating the chariot, black threatens to capture the horse, thereby disallowing the chance of an attack.||At this stage in the game, the end result has been  decided.[/DhtmlXQ_comment72]
[DhtmlXQ_comment104]And red sees that he is unable to hold on anymore and resigned with a smile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment104]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]And black would still be on the path to victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_51]Nope, the horse is poisoned![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]And black wins![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_46]Not advisable now...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]And black would actually cause himself much trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]Master Yang's suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_43]H7+9 is not feasible now![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_46]And black would have both material advantage and the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]nope...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_44]And red would have a hard time trying to handle black's aggression.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]"Master Yang explains why red did not make this move..."[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]And black would then play P5+1 on the next move to  attack the red horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_31]And it would still be an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_31]
