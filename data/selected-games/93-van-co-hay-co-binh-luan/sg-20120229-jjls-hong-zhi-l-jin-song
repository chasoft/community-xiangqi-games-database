[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120229 jjls Hong Zhi L Jin Song||This was a game played on 2010/08/14 by Red's GM Hong Zhi against black's Master Jin Song.||GM Hong Zhi needs no introduction. He is still one of the top 10 players in China today, and has represented China in many competitions abroad.||Master Jin Song was born in 1974, and hails from Shenyang,Liaoning Province. His greatest claim to fame was by winning a competiion held in 1998 by the AXF. He maintains a high winning percentage and amassed 2454 points in 2010. Master Jin remains a very powerful force and is one of the key players on the Shenyang Xiangqi team[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Master Jin is an expert on the reserved opposite direction cannons counter. With this opening, he has won against many many experts. ||When going up against an opponent of GM Hong Zhi's caliber, it was natural for Master Jin to use this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]C8=7 is another commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Post-game analysis suggested that this move did not do much. R8=6 seemed to be a better choice as red would still have full control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Postgame analysis deemed this as another redundant move with not much purpose.||H3+2 to maintain balanced development of the chess pieces seemed to be a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Red chooses to develop his bottom chariot by R1=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And black forces an exchange. ||After the exchange, red's cannon would become an obvious target for black attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]By playing the riverbank horse, red actually crowds his own chesspieces! The riverbank horse has not many places to go other than to protect the red cannon.||H4+6 is not feasible as the black horse is protecting that intersection. ||It also impedes the red chariot.||Post-game analysis suggests that red sacrifices the cannon to play R4+5, before winning forking and winning back material with R4=7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And both polayers readjust their formations in the previous few moves.||Post-game analysis of the game shows that after readjusting, red does NOT have any specific target to attack and the linking of the pieces are less than satisfactory.||Black on the other hand, has a very stable defensive formation, and is one pawn up.||At this stage, black has gained control of the game from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Post game analysis deemed this move as less than satisfactory.||Even though red's formation is not good, preventing the black pawn from charging forward would be more important than development of the chess pieces now. ||By playing this move, red actually allows black's pawn to wreck havoc.||Of all the moves, this play by red should shoulder most of the responsibility for red's loss.[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]Red just made his condition worse.||P3+3 would still enable red to last sometime.||Red played this move as a gamble to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]R8+3 is another viable alternative. ||Red would also be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]And red resigns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]This was the suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]and red still has a relatively fine opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
