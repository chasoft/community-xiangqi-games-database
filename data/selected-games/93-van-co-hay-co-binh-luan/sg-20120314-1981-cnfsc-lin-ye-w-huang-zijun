[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120314 1981 cnsfc Lin Ye w Huang Zijun||After taking a look at my annotated games section, I noticed a complete absenced of games played by female Grandmasters and masters.||Oops...||I quickly went through my library and I found this very nice game played in 1981.||GM Lin Ye took red against GM Huang Zijun. Miss Huang was the first ever female champion and is now residing in Australia. ||Miss Lin became grandmaster by winning this tournament. Miss Lin later moved to Italy.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]The Guangdong team knew that Lin Ye was the disciple of a well known Xiangqi player called Chen Deyuan??? who specialized in the Same Direction Cannons. ||By actually playing the Same Direction Cannons, Black actually comes into the game very well prepared.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Post game analysis suggests that E7+5 might have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And black cannot take the the red cross river chariot now. There would be a checkmate with C3+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]The comments in my book had this to say about this move...||Black does not care about her left horse and plays the black filed chariot with confidence, looks like Black has something in store for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And early into midgame, red offers a sacrifice to attack black's empy left flank.||GM Lin Ye was known for her fiery play!||War breaks out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Or C2+3 would check and capture the right black chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Post-game analysis suggested that red play R3=6![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And all of a sudden, Black is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment55]And red is forced to sacrfice the chariot or lose very quickly! Black was prepared to play R2=7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment60]Post game analysis suggested that this was a controversial move.||A much more aggressive move would have been R6=4![/DhtmlXQ_comment60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment68]Post game analysis suggests that this move was not as good as R8+6![/DhtmlXQ_comment68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment82]Post game analysis suggests that black should have played E3+5 to adjust his formation first. After all, red's pieces are now defending.[/DhtmlXQ_comment82]
[DhtmlXQ_comment90]Post game analysis again suggested this move to be questionable. P1+1 would have won the game for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment90]
[DhtmlXQ_comment92]In retrospect, if black played P1+1 to capture the horse, there would still be a chance of a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment99]And the horse is out![/DhtmlXQ_comment99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment108]K6+1 would have been better as black would still be able to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment108]
[DhtmlXQ_comment125]And black resigned.||Red prepares for the face to face laughing checmate with C7=5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment125]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_100]This would have been a much better move!||Red would still have some way to go before a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_100]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_92]correct move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_92]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_110]And no matter if black excchanges chariots or now, black would have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_110]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_97]And red would win![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_97]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_99]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_99]And red would surely win now with the huge material advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_99]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_80]nope...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_80]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_83]And red would capture the black pawn to force a draw.||Black's chariot would be unable to win against the combined defensive forces of 1h1a2e.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_83]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_74]And black would have more chances of winning the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_75]And red would be guranteed a win with overwhelming material advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_75]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_74]And black would also be better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_74]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_60]And black has a very powerful move with R2-1 on the next move.||Red would have big trouble trying to resolve the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_60]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_43]And red would be better off with more pawns and an intact defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_43]And red would have significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_20]And black would have prevented the red cannon from  traversing to the other side of the board to attack black's left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_14]This was another commonly played variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_25]and red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment13_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_23]and red would be prepared to sacrifice her elephant for gains in material development.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_23]
