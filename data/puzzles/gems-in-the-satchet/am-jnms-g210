[DhtmlXQ_comment0]am jnms g210||This is an interesting endgame!||The first move is the crucial move.||An initial analysis of the game shows that black's R4+1 kill is prevented by Red's cannon guarding the throat rank and Black's R4+9 is defended by the red chariot.||However, red has a menacing pawm at the center which disallows the black chariot from leaving the bottom rank. ||The pawn has effectively pinned all of black's pieces and only allows the black chariot to move on the bottom rank.||Red can make use of this fact to force a win.||Red's elephant is also an important defensive piece as it disallows P4=5. You will see why in the variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Correct move to make!||Red can win now!||Before this move, black's chariot is able to move to the 8th file and 9th file. ||Now it is only able to be moved to the 9th file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]correct move![/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Black has no immediate kill with the 2 pawns. And the black chariot is now blocked from the checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]An important idle move![/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]black tempts red instead! great move![/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red does not forget to defend! Crucial![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And Red is assured of victory now![/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]Black is guranteed a win now![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]and black would win instead as Black now has a kill with P5=4![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_11]and red would win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_8]and the red pieces are still pinned. P4+1 is still a threat and red cannot move his pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]and red is just one move faster for the kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]the defensive power of the elephant comes into play now! There is no way that black can resolve R6=4/R6+3 by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_11]now red has the coordinated 7,1 protected and black's chariot has no immediate kill now![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]Red would win now with P5=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_1]Red has just wasted a chance to win!||The black chariot cannot leave the bottom rank or there would be a checkmate with the red chariot.||The red cannon has protected against black's R4+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_8]Draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_7]wrong move![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]and black is guaranteed a victory with P6+1[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_5]If R4+1 , Black would win with R9+9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_6]and black would definitely win now. ||All black has to do is to maneuver the pawms to for the checkmate as the two chariots have pinned each other to the bottom rank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_6]
