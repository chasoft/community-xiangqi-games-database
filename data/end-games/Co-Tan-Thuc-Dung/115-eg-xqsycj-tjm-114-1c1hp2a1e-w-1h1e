[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 114 1c1hp2a1e w 1h1e||第114局 炮高兵单缺相胜马单象||A win is very likely if the 1c1hp side does not allow his opponent to exchange the cannon with his horse![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]In the endgame, the cannon is most efficient and powerful when it is placed near his side of the board , along the throat rank or the bottom rank as his advisors would be able to act as cannon mounts.||This rule of thumb has been aptly described with the phrased:“残局炮归家” or translated directly, the cannon goes back home in the endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Jim: An important move as the elephant would now prevent the horse from moving back to his side of the board easily. This would facilitate the movement of the pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Black tries to tag the cannon with the horse hoping to prevent or slow its attack.||The idea is that black would try to exchange his horse for the cannon such that the endgame would be simplified to that of a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]The red pawn cannot advance reckelessly. ||It MUST find ways of capturing the elephant for free. If not, even if the red pawn were to occupy the center of the palace, black would be able to force a draw by using the horse to shadow the cannon and use the elephant to make idle moves.||The 1c1p would not be able to win![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And red is sure to win with C1=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And C6=4 would checmkate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
