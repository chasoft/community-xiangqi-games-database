[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 003 1p pd 1c1a||||In this example, it is clear that black is the aggressor. If black were able to move his advisor to the cannon rank to control one of the rib file, a kill would be possible.||For red to force a draw, he would have to prevent that. Red MUST get his pawn close enough to the black king and a draw would materialize.||Also, if possible, the pawn could be used to exchange for the advisor, as withouth the advisor to act as a cannon mount, black's cannon would not be able to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]

[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Key move! ||The pawn prevents the advisor from moving A5+4 to act as a cannon mount. No cannon mount, no attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]And try as black may, the advisor is unable to move to the cannon rank.||Draw.||If black had two advisors, black would surely win as black would be able to achieve the goal of moving the advisor to the cannon rank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
