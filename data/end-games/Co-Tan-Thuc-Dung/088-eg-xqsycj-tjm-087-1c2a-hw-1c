[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 087 1c2a hw 1c||||Unlike the horse, the cannon has greater mobility and would be able to defend against red's 1c2a combination. ||For black to force a draw, his cannon must be placed in front of his own king, thereby discouraging or preventing red from controlling that file with the red cannon.||If need be, the black cannon would also block the red cannon's line of fire.||Black must prevent red from pinning the cannon and king in the same file by red's king.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Jim: Red would have trouble controlling this file now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Jim: Black has to move the cannon away or red would be prepared to win it with K5=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_10]After the exchange, it would be a draw.||If red refuses to exchange the cannons...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]...all that black would have to do is to keep his cannon in this rank, so that it would be able to defend against the red cannon should it attempt the face to face laughing checkmate.||Draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]This is another method of forcing a draw.||The black cannon would just block the red cannon, moving to the same rank as red's cannon.||The king would be used to move and make idle moves.||Jim: A perpetual block , as in this case, is allowed and a draw is the ruling if neither side wants to change their moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]
