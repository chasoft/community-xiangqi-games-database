[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 095 1c1hp w 1hp1a||||In this example, red's king and pawn are well positioned and already have control of the central file. ||As long as red is careful in making use of the cannon to capture the advisor, red would be able to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]P5+1 would be a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Another important move to make.||This is to allow the red king to act as red's cannon mount.||Jim: After the advsior has been caught, red must now think of way to apply the face to face laughing checkmate, while at the same time prevent the black pawn from defending. That is why the red king must act as the cannon's cannon mount, to prevent the black pawn from defending the central file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Jim: This is the reason why the red king has to act as a cannon mount.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Jim: And red would finish the game off with a repatriation of the buddha checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]

[DhtmlXQ_comment2_11]Repatriation of the Buddha checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_1]NOPE![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_4]And it would be a draw instead!||Red has been to rash to charge the pawn forward, thereby losing a cannon mount for the cannon to exert its influence on the game.||Draw!||Black would just simply move his pawn around.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_4]
