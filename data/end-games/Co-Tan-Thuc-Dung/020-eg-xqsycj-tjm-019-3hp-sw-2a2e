[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 019 3hp sw 2a2e||||Three high pawns are a sure win against a full guard (2a2e). But one must be careful and not advance the pawns too quickly. If the pawns were advanced too quickly, the opponent's king might have a chance to move to the cannon rank and it could be a draw.||For the three pawns to win, the following must be done.||1) one pawn must be used to block the elephants (ie be placed at the elephant's eye, and move 7 in this example).||2) the king would assist the other two pawns in controlling the rib files for double ghosts knocking on door check“二鬼拍门”techinique.||This is a very practical and efficient way of killing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]jim: one of the pawns is now in place.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Only way for red to win!||jim: the king must assist the pawns in advancing.||The red pawn on the 6th file has basically controlled prevented the black king from moving to that side of the palace. The remaining two pawns are now advanced with the aid of the red king for the final win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And black is unable to block.||If black had a pawn or some other chess piece to block the red king from assisting, it would be a draw. Unfortunately, it would be impossible in this setting.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]If black plaed A5+4, red would counter with K5=4 instead, and win in the same fashion as in the major variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red is sure to win now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
