[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 197 1r pw 2c 01||第197局 一车巧胜双炮（一）||In this example and the following one, red's chariot would be able to win.||The main reason is that the red king is able to assist the chariot in pinning the cannons and black king.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Key move!||This would force C5-1, and thus oppress the movement of the black king. The cannon would also have a hard time linking up with the other cannon for defense![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And red would now threatent to checkmate with R4+2.||Black would have to play K5=6 to resolove this threat and thus lose the bottom ranked cannon.||Red would win for sure now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And red's chariot has the cannons in a pinning predicament.||The cannons cannot leave the central file or at least one cannon will be lost.||As long as the chariot and the red king are on the same file, black's cannon would have to budge eventually.||Red would then win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]And red would move his king and chariot to force the cannons to budge from the central file, whereby one black cannon would be lost![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_13]And red would be sure to capture at least one cannon!||Jim: Red is threatening to checkmate with R5=6 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_7]The black cannon on the bottom rank would have to move along the bottom rank, and red would continue with K5=4! Red would threaten to kill and thus capture the cannon.||Jim: I have added a few more moves to help the beginner visualize.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_9]Jim: Threatening to checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_10]Only way to save himself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_13]And red would win for sure now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_13]
