[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 205 1r1p hw 1c2a2e||第205局 车兵难胜炮士象全||Under most circumstances, 1c2a2e would have enough defensive power to stop a combination of 1r1p. However, the technical demands for the 1c2a2e side is great and one must know how to defend. To force a draw, red must||a) use the cannon as an advisor, as in the example given. When the cannon is used in this manner, red's 1r1p is prevented from using the 1r1p1k combination for a concentrated attack.||b) the cannon and the elephants must be kept on different flanks, or they would risk capture by the red chariot. If they were all congested on one side, the red chariot would have plenty of chances to capture them.||c) even if the red pawn was a high pawn, the elephants and cannon should still be kept on different flanks. The cannon would also have to be used to protect the various elephant eyes. ||d) 1c2a or 1c2e or 2a2e would also be able to defend against 1 chariot, that is even if the pawn was used to exchange for red's material, it would still be a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]If black's elephants were on the riverbank now, red would be able to force a positional win with the help of a series of checks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]

[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And red would now get to destroy the central advisor and thus win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]And red would now capture the cannon with this check for the win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
