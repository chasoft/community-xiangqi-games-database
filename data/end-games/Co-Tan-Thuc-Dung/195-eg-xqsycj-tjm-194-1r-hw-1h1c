[DhtmlXQ_comment0]eg xqsycj tjm 194 1r hw 1h1c||第194局 一车难胜马炮||For 1h1c to try to force a draw against one chariot, the following two things MUST be achieved!!!||a) the cannon must be placed behind the king in the same file such that the cannon would control that file, and the horse could be used to make idle moves. This would be the best way to draw||b) if the black cannon were in front of the king, as in this example, the horse cannot move too far away such that it would be unable to protect the king and cannon. A draw would still be possible.||If the horse and cannon are unable to look out for each other, the chariot would have plenty of chances of winning![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]The horse does not leave the cannon too far away. ||The red chariot would be unable to steal a win![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]And red would be sure to to capture the cannon now!||Jim: the cannon cannot move C4-1 or red would checkmate with R2+2.I have added a few more moves for the beginner to appreciate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]And red would capture the cannon, and win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]And red would capture the cannon for sure![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
