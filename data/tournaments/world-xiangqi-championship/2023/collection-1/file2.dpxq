[DhtmlXQ_comment0]sg 20120908 1979 axf Hu Ronghua W Liu Boliang A30||ECCO A30 Elephant vs Left Cross Palace Cannon||ECCO：A30 飛相對左過宮炮||This annotated game was published in the first 2nd  edition of 北方棋藝, which has evolved to todays 棋藝 magazine. It was one of the top Xiangqi publications of its time. ||I had flipped through by dust filled boxes to find this one. Should be nostalgic for many of the senior Xq players. ||The competition was the 1st ever Asian Championships back in 1979.||Chinas IGM Hu Ronghua took on the late Thai Xiangqi king IGM Liu Boliang, which was recognized as perhaps the best Xiangqi player outside of China in that era (Sam Sloans Chinese Chess for beginners).||Commentary was provided by GM Hu himself, and he explains certain opening principles.||The following comments, in quotation marks were presented by the great GM himself.||Black played first back then but I have switched sides to accomodate the &quot;red first&quot; way of play we have today.||Enjoy![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]&quot;Mr Liu Boliang is a well known Xiangqi player in Asia and was a key player on the runner up team for the 7th Asian Team Championships. He was placed second runner up in the individuals section. ||I chose the elephant opening, hoping that my opponent would be unfamiliar with it. ||When Liu saw me play my first move, he smiled at me, went into deep thought and continued to play...&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]&quot;By pushing the pawn forward, black gets to prepare the path for his left horse and also hopefully slow the movement of reds right horse. However, reds right horse has not made its move yet, and its development is still unclear for black. Therefore, pushing the pawn forward would seem a little bit too early, and would give red a chance to counter accordingly.||It follows that, black has made his intentions clear of playing R9=8 for the filed chariot variation. With P7+1, black actually prevents himself from playing the riverbank chariot as a continuation of his filed chariot as his pawn would block it.||I think H8+7 would be a better move at this stage, allowing black to play the filed chariot as he deemed fit.||After the match, Liu commented that: most overseas (out of China) players feel that the elephant opening was a defensive oriented one, and do not pay much attention to it.||Black had made an unobvious mistake early in the opening, and perhaps this could be attributed to the &quot; lack of attention&quot; to the elephant opening.&quot;||Jim: that was way way back in 1979. times have changed. The elephant opening is now one of the most played , orthodox openings for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]&quot; I wanted to keep my options open with this ranked chariot move. &quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]&quot;Playing P3+1 now is not advisable...&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]&quot;The opening comes to an end. As can be seen, reds horses and chariots are active and ready to go while blacks right flank is congested and would have to take some time and effort to ease.||Reds opening can be considered to be successful.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]&quot;As can be seen from the board, red offers his pawn to try to increase his lead in the game, causing some distress for black.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]&quot;And blacks answer further worsened his plight. This move would be the main reason behind blacks loss in material and position, leading to his final downfall.||P3+1 would have been better..&quot;||Jim: Click on the variation below to see the GMs suggestion.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]&quot;After a series of exchanges, red has used one chariot in return for three of blacks chess pieces, with a net gain of one major piece. Coupled with the fact that red has one cross river pawn, the game has been decided at this stage.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment53]&quot;As can be seen, all of reds forces are in attack mode. Black cannot hold on much longer...&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]&quot;And black resigned.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_43]&quot;And red would apply a fork with the elephant. Black would lose his cross river pawn just like that.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]&quot;And blacks cannon at my palace corner would still be trapped , with no way to go. Red would still gain material.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]GM Hus suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]&quot;And although black would still be on the losing side, at least he would be still equivalent material wise and could still hold on.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]&quot;And red would have the slight advantage.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]&quot;Not advisable now...&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]&quot;And although red would have positioned his chariot favorably, the gain in advantage would be offset by black being able to have a riverbank chariot also.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_9]&quot;Gaining a pawn early into the game would be another viable option.&quot;[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_9]
