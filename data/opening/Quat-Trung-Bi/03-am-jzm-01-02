[DhtmlXQ_comment0]The Secret in the Tangerine Game 2||SD Cannons: RR vs FR, black moves his horse to the side first.||In game 1, black lost badly after taking the horse. One of the crucial moves in that game was R6+7 whereby red pushed his chariot into black's throat rank, with an attempt to immobilize black's right flank. In game 2, black tries to push[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]This is variation 14 in the old manual. ||Black tries this move to prevent the ill fate he experienced in game 1. ||Red has 2 answers to this : R6+6 and R6+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Second variation. ||Red has two choices to attack with||a) R6+7 and b) R6+6[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]There are 2 black choices, P1+1 and A6+5.||P1+1 is not a good move although black attempts to  free his horse to join in the battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red attempts to perform the horse sacrifice again, with a slight twist.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Red again sacrifices his left horse, and the following moves or variations will be similar to that of game one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black has two choices at this stage. ||1) Black does not learn his lesson and still takes the sacrifice.||2) Black dares not take the sacrifice now, and defends first with A6+5[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Red continues his attack in a fashion similar to game 1[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]From here on, this is similar to the variation 4 and 5 of game one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Some contemporary studies give H2+4 as a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]Black is forced to take this cannon or red will attempt a checkmate with R3+1 followed by R6=5[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Black tries in vain with a counter of his own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]With the king moving to the throat rank, all of black's attack are foiled immediately. ||1)The central black horse cannot move or red would checkmate with A6+5.||2) Black's chariot cannot leave the botton rank or red would checkmate with R3+2 followed by the angler checkmate with R6+1. ||3) Black's horse is thus lost and red has overwhelming positional and material advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]A more pleasing outcome for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_16]Red still has the initiative[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_10]Black has 2 choices to defend: P1+1 and A6+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_10]

[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]Thus far red has controlled black's entire right side ( positioning is relative to the side ).Some call it the parital blockad of one side, ?? ( Hanyu Pinyin: Dan1 Bian1 Feng1)[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]Red has the initiave after these few rounds.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]In this variation, black seems to have an acceptable outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_9]This variation is seldom used now. Most people know how to defend and if defended well, red would lose initiative. But for now, let us enjoy what the ancients have for us.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]Variation 12. ||Black has two variations. 1) C2+2 and 2) C2+4[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_11]Variation 10 of the ancient manual[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]Another sacrifice of red's left horse. Red would continue to utilize the same kills as in game one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]Black never learns![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]Red's other chariot joins in the attack. Black has a hard time now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]

[DhtmlXQ_comment5_35]Red will checkmate with C3=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_35]Red would win with R6=4 for the checkmate, no matter what black uses to block.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]2 choices for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]Red's left cannon is poisoned.. If black took it , R6=4 would result in an unresolvable checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]??[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_27]Red would win with K5=4 to force the iron bolt checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]Black will lose a chariot and red will have superior positioning and material advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_13]2 choices for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]Black just never learns...[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]A very bad move, resulting in the demise of black. The chariot is very poorly positioned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]Checkmate with R++4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_32]Not a bad result for black....[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_32]

[DhtmlXQ_comment12_33]Another beautiful sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_35]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_32]Poor move. R8+3 might have prolonged black's agony||...R8+3, R4+1 K6+1, C5=8 K6=5 but red still has much superior positioning. Red can pull back his cannon to check from the middle again, or his horse can join in the attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_20]2 choices for black, both bad...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_39]Checkmate with R5=6, R3=5 and R6+1 the next few moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]Red threatens to take the black's final remaininghorse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_21]

[DhtmlXQ_comment16_35]Brilliant! Red offers a sacrifice now to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_39]There seems to be a mistake in the variations for red should win with C5=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_38]Bad move!Black should move his chariot. R8=6, or R8=4 or R2+4 and still have a chance.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_47]Red would use the angler horse checkmate the next move, R6+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_47]

[DhtmlXQ_comment22_8]Black's other choice R8+4 is still widely used today.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22_10]Black pushing the pawn is considered old fashioned. It has its disadvantages. Contemporary study advises black to move A6+5 or H2+3 so that the game is more balanced. A4+5 is not advised as it puts black's king under extra pressure from red's chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22_14]This is a poor move by black. Red would make black pay dearly with his next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22_15]This fork off the horse and the chariot by red's cannon is called the monkey pulling horse fork. Black would lose a chess piece now. Black has moved ok up till the previous move with neither sides having the clear advantage. Frequently used moves for black now include A6+5, or C5=6 to change to the sandwich horses formation for defence. ||This is the 14th variation in the ancient manual.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22_15]
