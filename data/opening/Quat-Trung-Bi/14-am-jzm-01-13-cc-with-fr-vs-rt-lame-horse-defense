[DhtmlXQ_comment0]am The Secret in the Tangerine  ||Volume 1 Game 13  ||Central cannons vs Right Lame horse defence. ||In the previous game, we have seen the plight of the left lame horse defence. ||In this game, black uses the right lame horse defence.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Variation 1[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]This is the Right lame horse defense. Note the difference in the postioning of black's horses.||Normally, the side horse is not moved so quickly in mordern day games as it exposes the center too early.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Still sometimes used. C8=7 is used more often now. Courtesy of Li Geng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]

[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]R9=8 would have been even better for red. Li Geng's commentary.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]Seems like a good move but is in fact costing black the game. C2+2 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]H4+3 would be better[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_36]bad move, sealing off the king's escape route. H8+6 would be better as black can use the horse to exchange for the central cannon. By Li Geng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]Material and positional advantage to red. Red can take the advisor on the move with the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]

[DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]R8+8 would still have been a better move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]

[DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]P3+1 would have been better now, as suggested by Master Li Geng[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]This is a bad move. If the black cannon had not moved, they could still have linke up and provided defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_27]An even better move would have been R5+2!!! The kill would have been faster. See the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_27]

[DhtmlXQ_comment14_16]C2+4 would have been a better move.||... C2+4, H8+7 R4+6 and black would still have a chance.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_22]R4+6 to try to capture the horse would be a more aggressive move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_30]R4+2 would have allowed black to a chance. After all, black is already one chariot up.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14_30]

[DhtmlXQ_comment16_12]Not an advisable move. The cannon exchange is inevitable, moving the central pawn brashly would only allow red to make use of this move. ||Master Li Geng suggests C5-1[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_25]Black has no choice but to retreat R2-9 where red would still take the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_25]
