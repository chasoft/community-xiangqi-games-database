[DhtmlXQ_comment0]am jzm v2 game 07 ||Same direction cannons : Filed chariot vs slow chariot with elbow horse checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Variation 1[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]For those who do not know, normally black answers with R9+1 for the ranked chariot. ||If, as in this game, red moves the horse or P7+1 , without immediately mobilizing the chariot, this is called slow chariot variation. The idea for this is to see what red would move and then coutner more accurately. This opening gained favor in the 1980's and has since become an accepted opening or choice for players playing the same direction cannons openings.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This is not a good move by contemporary standards. P7+1 or C8=7 are the suggested moves. It is important to limit the movement of the black horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Under such circumstances, it would be better to go for the chariot exchange and then move P7+1 or H8+7. Red would still maintain his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Great move1 Black taunts red to take the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red does not go for the horse. Click on the variation below to understand why. ||The following moves were added by me for your perusal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Black's pieces are relatively more mobile now![/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is not a good move in retrospect. R9+1 would be better, tagging the horse to prevent it from causing trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]To be continued wth variations 3 and 4[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Variations 3 and 4.||Moving the chariot now is not advisable now. Li Geng and Yang dian have suggested that H9-7 or C6+5 to be better alternatives.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]To be continued with variation 2[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Variation 2[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]Variation 2 continued from the original variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]Red has more material and a winning position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]Variatoin 3 from the original manual ||This is a better move comparatively.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]The cannon cannot move away!!! R9+1 would be much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]Great kill! With this sacrifice, black goes for the palcorner horse checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]Variation 4 from the ancient manual[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]To be continued with variation 5[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]Variation 5[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]Bad move, C7+7 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]Black would win with C3=5 on the next move followed by R4=5.||If red guarded the above mentioned move with R8+2, black would kill with C3+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]These were the moves suggested by Li Geng and Yang Dian.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]And red would have the advantage[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]Variation 5 continued from variation 4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]Black would win with C2=5 on the next move.||If red moved H3+4, C5+4 would achieve the same result. ||If A5+6, black would kill with R4+1[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_14]Red has lost a chariot so early into the game and has yet to develop his left flank. The number of effective moves thus far is only 3 for red and 4 for black with black's pieces having better mobility. ||Advantage to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_14]
