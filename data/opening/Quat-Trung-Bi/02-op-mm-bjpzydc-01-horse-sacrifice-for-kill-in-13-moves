[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op mm bjpzydc 01 弃马十三着||This is a file from one of the BEST opening books that I know off from the past 2 decades or all time for that matter by Master Yan Wenqing and Zhang Qiang. ||||Opening traps are tactics used in the opening stages of the game. If they are successfully deployed, they can threaten, entice, instigate, confuse etc your opponent into making mistakes and give you a huge lead or even a win.||They can be a huge headache for beginners!||According to Xiangqi opening theory however, if there are traps, there should be ways to counter them.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And it becomes the same direction cannons: ranked chariot vs filed chariot. ||ECCO assigns it D03 but it should be a ranked chariot vs filed chariot variation.||Black's pawn rank chariot is now frowned upon although it was the move to play in ancient times. ||In modern times, R8+4 is played instead, allowing black more versatility to defend and attack and adjust his formation according to red's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Another ancient manual move, which has been criticized as being too rushed.||The suggested move now would be P7+1...||please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Another heavily criticized move. ||Black needs to improve his defense on the center with H2+3. But beginners might ask what would happen if red played H6=7?||Well, click on the variation to see!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]The infamous horse sacrifice to kill in 13 moves variation!!!||For beginners who do not know, this is game 1 of volume 1 of The Secret in the Tangerine!||Black has two options to choose from...||In the ancient manual though, red would play H2+3 followed by R1+1 instead of R1+1 followed by H2+3  for the second and third move. There is nothing wrong with the order of moves...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And black falls for the trap with this move ...||And this is a costly mistake that beginners would make, being tempted by the material gain at hand and failing to see the drastic kill that red could  work up![/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]And this is the follow up move to red's horse sacrifice.  What follows next is a string of superb attacks that would give red a win or a huge advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This is one of the variations in the Secret in the  Tangerine. Please go to the the section on this site for more...Very very nice kills![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red wins.||13 moves to a kill. ||The Horse sacrifice for mate in 13 moves variation . One of the best examples of wisdom from the ancients.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]Brilliant! ||Red threatens with the throat cutting checkmate by playing R6=5 on the next move!!!||Red is sure to win or have a huge advantage now.||I have added the moves for the beginner to see...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]one of the variations in the ancient manual![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]Good move by black, fortifying the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]And black does not fall for red's trap even though red tries everything to entice him! And red is forced to try to change his moves for another round of attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]Black refuses to fall for red's trap again!!!||Good move![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]And black would have used one chariot to exchange for 2 of red's pieces, while dissolving red's attack. ||Black can be satisfied !||||In this game, red's horse sacrifice early into the game is a classic example of an opening trap.||Black loses the game because black became too greedy for his own good.||In the variation provided by Master Yan and Master Zhang, black defends appropriately, giving and exchanges chess pieces to eliminate red's threats at the appropriate time. And all things being equal, black would still have a game going on.||Of course, one of the better ways would be to refrain from playing H2+1 on the fifth move for black, thereby eliminating all the trouble early on.||For beginners, this is one of the best instructive games to learn of ALL time, because not only various tactics are shown, red demonstrates many different killing techniques.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]ouch...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]Ho ho ho!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]Red throws everything out of the window, including the kitchen sink for this kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]Wow!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]Smothered checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_14]And black would have C2=6 or C8=7 as one of the many many aggressive counters that would wrestle the lead away from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_14]And red would lose at least one chariot, for a horse. not a bad bargain![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_9]modern day suggestions![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]And red would be faster in gettting his chess pieces out for the fight![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
