[DhtmlXQ_comment0]am The Secret in the Tangerine Volume 1 Game 12.||Central cannon with file chariot vs Left Lame horse defence.||Finally, we get to a new opening for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Variation 1[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Variation 9 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Variation 9. To be continued with variation 7. ||Black's opening is called the lame horse defense or  单提马.||It is quite an old opening . One of the criticisms of black's defence is the inadequate protection of the center where red will attack ferociously.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Variation 7, to continue with variation 4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Variation 4. ||Thus far, this is the opening still seen occasionally in competition nowadays. ||Black would have preferred to move the chariot earlier though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]This variation is about charging the central pawn. ||Red knows black's weakness is at the center. Let us see how red attacks...[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Contemporary study by Li Geng shows that E7+5 would have been a better move, as black has a move of C2+1[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Central linked horses attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]P5+1 would have been a better move, limiting the movement of the red horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]To be continued with variation 2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Variation 2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Forcing an exchange of chariots , thereby gaining a horse in the process. ||Red has the positional AND material upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]Variation 2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]Variation 3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]Very ingenious move. If black takes the chariot with the horse, a double cannon checkmate would immediately kill black with RC+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]Red prefers to kill rather than take the chariot. Good choice![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]Nice sacrifice!!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_40]Even if black moved C4=5, red would still make the same move for the checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]Variation 3 continued from variation 2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]C2+1 would have been much better, according to Li Geng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]Good sacrifice move, forcing the king to the roof top of the palace, where it is most vulnerable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]Moving the horse to the center would not make much of a difference. The chariot just has to take the horse and repeat the same moves as below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]Variation 4, continued from the variation 1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]Contemporaray study shows that C2=5 would have better results for black, as it forces the game into an attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]Contemporaray study by Li Geng shows that R2+8 would have been a much better move as it tries to prevent red's left chariot from joining in the attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]Variation 5 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]Variation 5[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]Beautiful![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]A double cannon checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]Variation 5 continued from variation 4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]R2+2 might have been a better move![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]To be continued with variatin 6. And the worst possible black move possible. ||This move is responsible for black's quick death. ||K5=6 would have increased the king's longevity.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_35]Variation 6[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_37]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_36]These moves were added by Li Geng.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]Variation 6 from variation 5[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_5]Continued from variation 7. This is the work of mordern day study.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_6]Again, A6+5 should have been better, according to Li Gneg[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_12]P5+1 would be a better move. by Li Geng[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_32]Continued with variation 8[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]Variation 8[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]Huge advantage to red![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_33]Continued from variation 7[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_40]The king cannot take the chariot or be killed with R7=6[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_47]Smothered cannon checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_4]Continued from the 9th variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_24]P4=2 to control red's cannon and chariot would have been better. This was the advice given by Li Geng[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_26]C4=2 would still be a better move, Li Geng insists.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_29]Fierce sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_35]Great move, attacking and defending at the same time. Click on to see why![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_41]Red throws everything in for the final kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_41]
