[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c5 98 p with td vs p||第98局对兵局转兵底炮 ||||ECCO：E48 對兵轉兵底炮對左中炮||ECCO：E48 Pawn with Thundering Defense vs Left Central Cannon[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]The Pawn vs Pawn opening has been around for a long time. One of its characteristics is that it adopts a wait and see characteristic and is very versatile. Instead of starting to maneuver the chess pieces immediately, the pawn side 'sounds' the opponent out and would later define his attacking formation based on a more precise counter according to the opponent's moves.||Playing the thundering defense for red is one of the major variations. Again, it was made to sound black's game plan.||Playing H8+7 now most probably lead to an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Other than C2=5, black can also play:||1) E7+5 --> red would have the slight lead||2) E3+5 --> red would be slightly better||3) C8=5  --> red would have the marked advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]A timely move to make!||This is a continuation of C2=3 and it would allow red to maintain the efficiency of his moves.||Playing H8+7 now would result in red losing control of the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Black on the other hand, cannot play C5+4 now, or black would have increased his lead in the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Good move!!!||Playing H8+7 would surrender the lead to black.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And this is correct move to make.||Playing R1=2 would give red the lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]E7+5 is another possibility but it would become very complicated.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This would seem to be a rash move.||E7+5 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red counters brilliantly. Red would now be able to move the cannon to the center to attack the black hosre. That way, red would be in firm control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And red would hold on to the lead firmly.||Summary: ||Red plays the thundering defense after P7+1. According to what we have learnt thus far, red should be better.　However, black is able to counter this thundering cannon move and slow down the development of the chess pieces to obtain a balance. ||Please compare the comments given in the variation and sub variations to have a better grasp of this opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]And it would quickly become a complicated game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]And red would have successfully protected the pawn and developed his right flank.||Red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_12]And red's pawn on the 3rd file would face capture. The moves that had been used to maneuver the pawn would thus be wasted and red would have lost tempo in the game.||Black would have successfully gained control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]And red would play H1+3 on the next move to chase the central black cannon. ||Black would be in a dilemma as to deal with his central cannon.||Red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_8]And the black horse makes it to the riverbank easily. Red's C2=3 would not have achieved his plan of limiting the movement of the black horse. ||Black has wrestled the lead and control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]And red would still have the slight control in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]And red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]And red would be markedly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_5]If red played the central cannon, the opening could easily become the central cannon vs the screen horse opening system.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]And this would become an approximately equal game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]
