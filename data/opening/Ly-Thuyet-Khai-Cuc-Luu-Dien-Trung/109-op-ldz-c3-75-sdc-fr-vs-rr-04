[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c3 75 sdc fr vs rr 04||第75局顺手炮直车对横车（4）      ||  ||ECCO：D29 順炮直車對橫車||ECCO D29 Same direction Cannons: Filed chariot vs Ranked chariot ||||Jim: This is the last board introducing the sdc: fr vs rr.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]As can be seen, black uses the double ranked chariots to answer red's double headed snake pawn formation. This is a very complicated variation and a very aggressive one. One of the main variations is introduced in this opening.||Jim: For beginners, when one player advances P3+1 and P7+1 in the opening, the pawn formation is called the double headed snake pawn formation. The advantage is that red (as in this case) gets to develop his own horses while slowing down the opponent's horses. However, the downside is that other than the horses, the other pieces are poorly developed. That is why black uses the double ranked chariots in retaliation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]E7+9 is the major variation introduced in this opening.||Othere than this move, the following are possible alternatives:||1) Red C8+3 --> and black would be slightly better||2) Red A6+5 --> and red would be slightly better||3) Red H3+4 --> and it would be a rather even game. ||Jim: Please click on the variations below to understand why. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Using the chariot on the rib file to patrol the river has been somtimes criticized as too passive, although it provides significant defense.||Other commonly played variations include||1) R1=3 --> red would have an easy time||2) P3+1 --> red would have the advantage||3) R4+5 --> red would be slightly better.||Jim: Please click on the variations below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]It would be red's advantage if black played R4=2 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]P7+1 by black now would give red the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red is slightly better, but black can live with this outcome.||In summary, ||the key issue in this variation is the impact that red's riverbank horse has on the game. If red were able to maintain the advantage given by this horse, red should be able to reach a favorable outcome in the opening.||Jim: And this wraps up our introduction of the sdc: fr vs rr.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red is slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]Red is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]R1=3 --> red would have an easy time[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]And it would be an attacking game for both sides with red having the easier time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]P3+1 --> red would have the advantage[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]Other viable options for black include||1) R4+5||2) P5+1||3) C2=1||Jim: There were no variations or further moves showing these subvariations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]Red has managed to hold on to the lead in the opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_14]R4+5 --> red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]And red is slightly better![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]And red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment9_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_13]Red C8+3 --> and black would be slightly better[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_30]And black is better as his chess pieces are more evenly developed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_13]Red A6+5 --> and red would be slightly better[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]Jim: For beginners, since red has the double headed snake pawn formation, one of the ways for red to develop his horses is via the center, with the central linked horses , aka madarin duck horses 鴛鴦馬.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_27]And red would still hold on to a slight lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_16]Nope, not advisable....[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_23]Jim: for beginners, black has moved the same chariot too many times, only to be exchanged for red's chariot which has made only one move. ||Red has increased the lead in the game as his chess pieces are now much more developed than black's.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_41]And red has the material advantage, togehter with control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_13]Red H3+4 --> and it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_26]A relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_26]
