[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 54 cc5paprr vs sch7pa||第54局中炮急进过河车对屏风马7卒直横车对左马盘河 ||Red uses filed and ranked chariots while black plays C2+1.||||ECCO：C20 中炮過河車七路馬對屏風馬兩頭蛇||ECCO：C20 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th Filed Horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double headed snake pawn formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Utilizing the left ranked chariot is a very popular variation by red in modern times.||There has been volumes written about this move and the variations that come about. It would be impossible to introduce all within the scope of this book.||Instead, a few major, basic variations will be discussed instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Black can choose to play C2+1 which is another major variation.||But whatever black does, black cannot and should not move C8=9 to attempt an exchange of chariots.||Jim: Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black would sometimes play E3+5 or C2=1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Red would be better if black tried C2+2 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Red should not play P5+1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red would be slightly better||Red's C5=2 is a good move as it prevents black from moving E3+5 to fortify his formation. That way, red would hold have control of the game firmly in hand.||In summary:||This variation was very popular in the 1970's and 1980's. Red's two chariots controlled very important files and ranks, allowing for red to continue his attack.||Black would have a hard time dealing with red's continued attack and that is why black's variation in this board is seldom used nowadays.||　[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]Not advisable![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]And black would force red to exchange horses and red's attack would be greatly weakened.||The game would become very drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]And the rest of the moves that follow would be the  same as the major variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]Not advisable![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]And black would seize control of the game from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]And red would have a huge advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]And red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_37]And red would gain material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]And red would have paralyzed red's entire cannon rank with this move.||Black would not be able to protect and strengthen his central file.||Red would play P5+1 on the next move and threaten to gain substantially.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]
