[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020401 move the advisor elephant carefully||In the early stages of the game, it would be appropriate to move the advisors and elephants for various purposes. However, they must be done only when there is a significant need to do so. Otherwise, their movement would be done at the expense of the development of the other chess pieces.||Sometimes, moving the advisors and elephants TOO EARLY would result in your formation being fixed. This would mean that there would be less flexibility and that there would be less options for attack and defense.||On the other hand, fixing your formation so early would allow your opponent to formulate his plans of attacking more precisely and even provide  targets for attack. ||Therefore, when faced with the critical decision of playing the advisor or the elephant, one must think twice. Which advisor/elephant to move, and where to move it are very important things to consider.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]In this example, red starts the game with the central cannon and filed chariot. Red decides to play the P7+1 variation, which is perfectly all right.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And black decides to use the left cannon blockade variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And red fears black's C8=5 and counters defensively with A4+5.||It would be an even game now, and red would have lost the advantage he had by default.||The biggest culprit for red's plight would be A4+5 as it had greatly delayed the development of the other chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
