[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 66 ccrrr5paclh vs sch||第66局中炮横车盘头马对屏风马3卒 ||||ECCO：C14 中炮右橫車對屏風馬||ECCO：C14 Central cannon with right ranked chariot vs screen horse defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]In this board, black has played the screen horse defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement variation. Red has chosen to attack with the right ranked chariot and central pawn advancement variation.||This is another very old opening, which has been around for several hundred of years.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]In the past, A4+5 was usually played. The moves given in the various ancient manuals are as follows:[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black counters aggressively with a central canon of his own. This is the advantage of playing the advisor (A6+5) instead of E7+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]C5+2 is another possible option whereby black would still be ok.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And it would be a rather even game.||This variation was an actual game played in the 18th 5 Rams Cup. ||Summary:||Black's A6+5, horse exchange and C2=5 have slowly chipped away at red's attack.||Black's center would be adequatly protected and red would have an a hard time trying to attack from there.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]And red would not have increased his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]

[DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]And black would be safe from the attack by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]And black would also be safe from red's attack.||The game would become very darwish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]
