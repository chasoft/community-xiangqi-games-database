[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 39 ccrrr7fh vs sch 02||第39局中炮横七路马对屏风马右士象 ||Black plays the right advisor and elephant for defense.||ECCO：C13 中炮右橫車對屏風馬||ECCO C13 Central cannon with right ranked chariot vs Screen Horse Defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]A4+5 has been played for decades and still is often seen in competition nowadays.||Jim: in the previous board, black chose the C8+2 variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Edging the cannon is one of the better counters for red.||Playing R4+3 now would lead to an even game as black could counter with C8=9. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This is a better move than playing R1=2 now.||If black did indeed try R1=2, red would play H7+6 and firmly hold the lead in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]With this move, red pushes the game into a situation whereby both sides would be attacking one flank.||If red tried P5+1 now, black would be able to hold his own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]This move has been tested and prove in actual competition to be a good choice for red.||Threatening to capture the black horse now would force black to reveal his intentions and red could counter accordingly.||Please click on the following variations to see other possible but less ideal moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Black is forced to come to a decision on how he would deal with red's threat of capturing this horse.||If he did not make this move, and tried H7+8 to protect this horse instead, red could play E1+3 and the moves that follow would be red's advantage.　||Please click on the variations to see them.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]If red played H7+8 now, black would counter with C7=8 and the game would quickly become an attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]C8+7 now would be to red's advanatage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]If red tried P5+1 now, black would counter with R8+6 and red would gain nothing in the process.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black plays the riverbank cannon for a sacrifice first before gaining back the lost material.||Red would be the beneficiary if black played C7=8 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]An ingenious move by red!||Red would lose a chariot if he played P7+1 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]A possible alternative for black would be to play R8+4.||Jim: but no moves were given in the book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And red would hold on to the slight lead.||In summary, black's A4+5 move in move 6 would seem  to be a defensive move but in reality, it would actually quicken the pace of attack for both sides. The main reason for this is that black shows defensive weaknesses in his side too early, and is prone to targetted attacks by red.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]And black has skillfully gained at least one chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]And red would be poised to attack. Red is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]And red has gained nothing in this exchange while black has gained a pawn and managed to reposition his cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]Jim: Just in case you were wondering...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]and black would capture the red chariot with this discovered check.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And the game would quickly progress into a fistfight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_29]And it is obvious that red is much better!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_42]And red has the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_35]Jim: Just in case you were wondering why this cannot be done...[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_36]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_32]And the game would be tied up in knots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]And black would be able to hold his own in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_15]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment12_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_20]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_20]
