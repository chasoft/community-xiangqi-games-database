[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 21 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C49||第21局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红连冲中兵型 ||||ECCO：C49 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C49 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Red advances the cental pawn across the river.||Jim: This is another big variation in the cc vs sch saga. Very exciting variation. Little room for  error.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red charges the central pawn on consecutive moves. ||It was especially fashionable in the National Championships way back in 1962, and this variation is a very important variation in the central pawn vs Screen Horse Defense with Edge Cannon for Chariot exchange variation. ||The characteristics of this variations include:||Red decides against a balanced developement of his chess pieces in favor of a blitzkrieg attack down the center.||If Black does not prepare in advance, and counters inappropriately, black would be in danger of a very fast defeat.||Jim: Very little room for error. A high level of precision is required.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Black cannot play P5+1 for the counter or red would have a huge advantage! Red would counter with H3+5. ||Click on the variation to understand why!　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]P7=6 was played in the past. ||Black's line of reasoning was that if red took the pawn sacrifice, it would slow down his attack. ||Unfortunately, in actual play, Red was still able to attack all the way.||Jim: Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Black's chariot becomes aggressive to control this throat rank, preparing to offer a horse sacrifice for an attack down red's right flank.||H3-4 would give the game to red.||Jim: Click on the variation below to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]If black tried H7+8, red would play R4=3 and red would be have the huge advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red intends to sacrifice material first before gaining it back with this move. This is one of the newer variations that has been seen in competition the past few years.||Other commonly played variations include H6+7,H7-5, A4+5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Correct counter from black! C2+5 would fall immediately into Red's trap![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Red cannot play R3-3 now or it would be to black's advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]And it would be a relatively even game.||After a series of exchange, the pace of the game has slowed down. ||Although red has gained one extra cross-river pawn, his left chariot has yet to move and that would be a major concern. Black should be able to hold his own in the game to come. ||||In summary: ||in this variation, Red chooses to to attack down the center, while black counters with an attack aimed at red's right flank. The exchanges are very volatile with little room for error.||It is very easy to lose the game in a jiffy.||When choosing this variation in actual competition, one must be very familiar with various attacking technqiues as it places a great demand on such skills. If not, it would be very hard to control the game. ||Jim: Always loved this variation![/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]Black is much better!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]Jim: Why the red cannon is poisoned![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]And black would be in all sorts of trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_39]And red would have a strong attack going on, despite the chariot sacrifice!||Jim: This variation is quite famous for its chariot sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]Too passive![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]Jim: Black cannot take the red chariot. I have added the variation to explain why![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]And red sacrifices his way for a seething attack!||Black is in big trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]In the past, red would play C8=4 or C8=5, but the better results gained with this move proved its superiority over the above mentioned moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]And red would be better off in terms of the extra elephant and room for development.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]Jim: This is a must make move for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]And red is much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_25]
