[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0101060101b Development of the Chariot||||a) Ample room for chariot development part 2||||In the opening stages of the game, the troops have made initial contact. The position of the chariots at the early opening stages may not directly decide the game, but it would have a profound effect on the early stages of the opening.||||A general rule of thumb: whichever side is able to utilize and develop the chariots faster such that the chariots are able to control the important points on the board are most likely to have the early advantage.||||As seen in the board on the left, if red were to move first, all that he would have to do would be to move R1=4 and he would occupy the only route available for development of his chariot. It would also inhibit the development of the black chariot. Red would be much better then.||||The above two examples show the importance of the speed of development of the chariots. In the early stages of the opening, the main goal for developing the chariot would be to try to control the important files or ranks. Being able to do so would allow better positioning of the other pieces and improve your opening as a whole.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
