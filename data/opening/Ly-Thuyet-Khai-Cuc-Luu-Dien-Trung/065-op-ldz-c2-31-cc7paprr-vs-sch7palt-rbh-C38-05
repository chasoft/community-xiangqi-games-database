[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 31 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C38 05||第31局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红高左炮型退车捉马 ||ECCO：C38 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C38 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation||Jim: Please compare this variation to the previous variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]By retreating the chariot to try to capture the horse, this is an improvment over the previous board. ||This variation is quite important in that it greatly boosted red's R8+1 and nearly eliminated red from playing R2=4.||The main reason for this is that it would allow red easier control of the game and allow red to maintain his lead relatively easily. And it was a favorite for red players in its era. ||As can been seen, black has a few options other than P7+1, which will be discussed in the variations in the next move below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Major variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]H3-1 would also allow red to maintain the lead.||Please see the variation included![/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]If black chose R1+1, the game would become very complex quickly.||Jim: Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]R2+3 for the exchange would push the game into a fistfight.||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This is a flexible option for black, allowing more options for attack and defense as the game progresses.||H3-5 would be to red's advantage. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Choosing to play the palcorner cannon is one of the more versatile options. ||The advantages include the ability to discourage black from moving C2-1 (red can counter with C4+6 mow) and also threaten with a skewer with C4+5.||Playing C8=3 now would give the game to black instead!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And red would be still able to maintain his lead in the game.||In summary,||The two games are but a tiny fraction of this huge variation. They can be thought to be a concentrated dose of it but it would be foolish to think that the variations listed are able to show the intricacies of this major variation in full.||In comparison, R2-1 is much better than R2=4 (followed by C5=6) for red, allowing better control of the game. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]And Black is much better now, having concentrated his forces on a relatively empty red right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]And red is much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]And it is more of an offensive game for both, with  areas of concerns to address.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]And both sides would be attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_25]Red would still have the lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_35]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_29]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_29]
