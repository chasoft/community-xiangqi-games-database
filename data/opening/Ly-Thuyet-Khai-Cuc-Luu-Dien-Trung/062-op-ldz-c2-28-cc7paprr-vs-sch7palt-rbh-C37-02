[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 28 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C37 02||第28局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红冲中兵型||||ECCO：C37 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C37 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation||Red charges P5+1.||Jim: A very aggressive P5+1 red variation is discussed in this board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is the variation discussed in this board.||Red opts for a quick attack a quick attack with this move, targeting black's center as it has been weakened since black played H7+6.||It was once very popular in the 1950's but has gradually been discarded and is seldom seen nowadays in compeititon. ||Jim: But the moves shown by the GM show that red still has a fight if played correctly in some of the variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]A must make move for black, otherwise, red would have the game in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]As seen from the diagram, be it R2=4 or R2-1, black would be satisfied ![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]P7+1 is a possible counter, but it would be an attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]H5+3 is another option with red holding the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Tight and very target oriented move!||C8=3 now would be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Nice sacrifice!||This would halt red's attack.||In the past R8+6 was played but statiscal evidence  shows that red would have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And black would be slightly better!||In summary, the moves shown in the variations above demonstrate much fluidity. Each move has a profound consequence on the next move. This is also one of the major variations in the left riverbank horse variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]"move that was used to be played"[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]And both sides are attacking viciously but red would be the better of both.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]And red would be better!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]And red would have a fierce attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]And both sides would be on the attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]Black can be satisified with this outcome.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]And now black has seized control of the game away from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]And red is much better.||Jim: Red has now a central cannon and both his horses are ready to attack from the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]
