[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 01 ||cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx ||中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车 红兑车型||ECCO C40 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||ECCO：C40 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||||Jim: This is the first board discussed by the GM. ||It is also perhaps the most commonly played opening nowadays. The fundamentals are explained clearly. All comments belong to the the GM unless I feel the need to add certain points to clear things up for the beginner.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Both red and black push their pawns forward to develop their horse. This is even more important for black (as his left flank is now slightly congested). ||In the screen horse opening, black must try at all costs to keep at least one horse active.||If both horses are restricted by the opponent's pawns, as the opening progresses, this could prove to be a major weakness. ||That is why, it is recommended that if red advances the 3rd or 7th pawn, the screen horse side would advance the other pawn so as to maintain the balance of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black forces red to decide whether to accept the chariot exchange with this move.||This is one of the most commonly played variations to this opening. ||Other played variations include H7+6, R1+1, E7+5 and A4+5, all of which will be introduced in later sections.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Because red accepts this exchange, his efficiency and advantage by default would be decreased. That is why in competition nowadays, red seldom accepts  the exchange offer and chooses to play R2=3 instead.||By playing R2=3, red would be able to maintain a tight attack, and also push the game to a more complicated and exciting one. This has become one of the major variations in Xiangqi nowadays.||This variation would be discussed in the next section.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]As seen in the diagram, black could consider playing C2+4 as a viable alternative, although red would still have the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black could also consider A4+5. ||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And it would be a relatively even game.||Red's riverbank horse is a major threat to black but his left chariot is stuck and would take some time to be effective. This has become a tanggled game for both sides.||Short summary:||Red's acceptance of the chariot exchange at move 6 is considered to be a more balanced approach to the game, at the cost of giving the slight advantage that red has by default. As seen in the moves that follow, the game becomes sticky for both sides.||Although it is seldom used nowadays, it is nevertheless an important variation that the beginner must know. Sometomes, in actual play, for strategic considerations, this variation could also be used.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]And the moves played in this variation are more or less the same as the one introduced in the major variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_14]Jim: the GM shows why C2+4 is also viable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]And red would be slight better off but the game is still playable for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]
