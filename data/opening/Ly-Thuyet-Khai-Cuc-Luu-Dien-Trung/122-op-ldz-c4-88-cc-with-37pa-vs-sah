[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 88 cc with 37pa vs sah||第88局中炮两头蛇对反宫马 ||||ECCO：B31 中炮對反宮馬||ECCO：B31 Central cannon vs Sandwiched Horse Defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Jim: Red pushes both the 3rd and 7th pawn forward to faciliate development of his horses while inhibit the development the development of the black horses. Pushing the 3rd and 7th pawn forward at the same time is known as the double headed snake pawn formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]A chariot exchange so early in the game would often be more detrimental than benficial, which is why Xq players seldom do so.||However, in this scenario, red has already pushed the 3rd and 7th pawn forward, offering an exchange of chariots so early would prevent black from playing R8+4 to patrol the riverbank and push his 3rd and 7th pawns forward to develop his horses. That is why red would not lose any tempo in the process.||If red chose to play C8+7, black would be able to counter nicely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]As seen from the board now, red's pawns have inhibited the black horses.||This would be the key issue to address in this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]E3+5 is another often played variation, but red would be better most of the time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red could also consider playing H2+1 and as the game progresses, decide whether to develop the left chariot as a filed chariot or a ranked chariot.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]E3+5 is another alternative but black would have a nice formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And red would be slight better.||Summary:||After the early chariot exchange, the focus of the game would be on the development of the 3rd and 7th files for both sides. Whichever side that manages to develope the 3rd or 7th file first would have the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]P7+1 would be played next. ||Black's formation would be very formidable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]And red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_12]And black would be able to counter nicely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_12]
