[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Playing the left central cannon instead of the usual C2=5 (rt cannon) has been a variation that has been explored and studied in the recent years.||However, C2=5 is still more often played.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]A natural move to make. For black, the most important thing to do now is to develop his chariots.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Playing H8+7 would allow black a huge advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Black chooses to have practical gains instead of playing R9=8.||R9-8 would also be a feasible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Playing R9+1 now would allow red to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This has been a very popular variation in the past couple of years and has received much attention.||If red chose to play C2=1, red would only be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]A proactive choice from black. ||If black chose to defend with A4+5, red would be able to control the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red fights fire with fire.||It would not be advisable to play C5=7 as black would be slight better.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]This is to prevent black from playing C5=6 (the elephant has been blocked), and is quite an aggressive move in continuation of red's strategy a few moves ago.||Playing H9+7 would lose tempo.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And a fistfight begins. ||Correct move!||If black chose to continue with C5=6, red would have the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And black offers a counter-sacrifice to dampen red's attack. Correct move.||If black became greedy and chose to play R6-2, red would simply play R5-1 and red would suddenly have a very fiery attack.　||Jim: The effects of red's R8=6 on move 12 can be fully comprehended now![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Draw.||Summary:||This variation has received much attention and improvement over the past few years. It has been used many times in recent competition and has been analysed in detail. ||Red allowed the black pawn to cross the river (move 4) to allow development of his chariots.||However, if red were to try to eliminate this same threat later on, he would often have to pay a price and allow black to obtain a new balance in the game. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]And red would have a very furious attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]And red would lose tempo in the game.||Jim: For beginners, that is because the chariot would have to move now and quite a few moves would have been wasted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_43]And black would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]And red would be in control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And the game would become a chairotless. It is quite an even situation for both sides but red would have the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]And red would be on the attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_18]And black would still be able to hold his own in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]And red would sacrifice his horse to launch an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_16]And black would have very good development of his chess pieces after the pawn sacrifice and is able to launch a counter attack of his own now.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_16]
