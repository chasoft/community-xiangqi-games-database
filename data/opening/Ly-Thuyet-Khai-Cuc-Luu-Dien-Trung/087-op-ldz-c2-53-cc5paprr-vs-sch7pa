[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 53 cc5paprr vs sch7pa||第53局中炮急进过河车对屏风马7卒红五九炮||Red uses the 59Cannons||||ECCO：C20 中炮過河車七路馬對屏風馬兩頭蛇||ECCO：C20 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot and 7th Filed Horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double headed snake pawn formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]There are three other moves that black might consider, but they would be to red's advantage. ||Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]As can be seen , red has chosen to use the 59 Cannons.||It was very popular back in the 1970's, but has been replaced by R9+1 since. 　||Jim: R9+1 will be introduced in the next board!||A must see board![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Red would have the initiative if black chose to play E3+5 for defense now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Playing R1=2 would cause both cannon and chariot to be pinned by red's chariot in the same file.||Making this move would not.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This was an improvised move.||With this offer of an exchange, black would successfully dampen red's attack.||Jim: I think it is because of this move that rd chose to play the more modern R9+1 in move 6 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And it would be a rather even game.||The chances for a draw are very high, which is something that red would not want.||In summary:||Red's pawn ranked chariots are the major attacking pieces. That is why for black to decrease the pressure led by this move, black would play C2+1 to chase away red's pawn ranked chariot. This would effectively put a wrench in red's plans for attack.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red has the initiative in this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]And red has increased the lead in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]And red would be starting a seething attack.||When compared to red's the central cannon with 7th Pawn advancement and pawn ranked chariot, this current formation would be much better for red as red would need not worry about developing his lef horse. All he as to do is to develop his horses down the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]And red would have the significant advantage.||Jim: Both of red's horses are now ready to go and red has managed to concentrate his forces on black's empty right flank. ||The cross riverbank chariot would also temporarily  prevent the black horses from mischief.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]And after red sacrificed his horse, he gains much control of the board. The black horse would be captured in a matter of time.||Red is much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]
