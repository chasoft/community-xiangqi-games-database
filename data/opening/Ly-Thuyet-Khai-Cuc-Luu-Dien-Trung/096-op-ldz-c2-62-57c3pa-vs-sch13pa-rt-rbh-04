[DhtmlXQ_comment19]As can be seen on the board, red chooses to play R9=6 in this variation. This is a more steadfast approach to the game, and its main goal is to control this rib file. Red would slowly move his deploy his forces for attack.||This is a slower paced variation as compared to the earlier variations.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And black would try to foil red's plans with this move. This is a very target oriented counter from black.||If red chose A6+5 now, red would probably have the advantage.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Black should not play A4+5 now or red would have the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]

[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And it would become a relatively even game.||In summary:||By playing C2=1, black takes aim at red's side horse, and thus giving his chariot in the same file more power. ||This move would allow black to suppress red's attack and force the game to become even.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
