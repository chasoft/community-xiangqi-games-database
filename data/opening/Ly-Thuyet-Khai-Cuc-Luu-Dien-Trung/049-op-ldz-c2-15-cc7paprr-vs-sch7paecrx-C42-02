[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 15 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C42||第15局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车黑右横车型（2）   ||||ECCO：C42 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C42 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: Please refer to the previous board before you start this one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Jim: This is the main reason for black's right ranked chariot. Black would now threaten to capture the red chariot with C9=7 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]As seen in the board now, red charges his horse forward, hoping to save his pawn ranked chariot with H6+5 on the next move.||Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]If black tried A6+5, red could counter with either R3-1 or R9=8, and both variations would weigh in red's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]If red chose P5+1, the moves that ensue would prove to be an even situation for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]If red were to become greedy and chose to play R3=7 now, black would offer a sacrifice and would have a fierce counterattack.||Please click on the variation below to understand why.　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And the game would become a standoff. Both sides would now have urgent issues to address.||In summary,||In this variation, both red and black would gradually evolve to center their attack on one side of the board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]After the sacrifice, black has a ferocious attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And it would be an even game for both![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]Jim: I added this variation to show the beginner why black cannot exchange chariots now...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]Check![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]And red would be on the upperhand material wise.||Black's disorgainzed formation is prone to be attacked by red's remaining chariot on the board now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]And red would be slightly better![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]And red is slightly better![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]no no no!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_24]And the red chariot is captured. Black is on the winning side now![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]If red's chariot tried to run away...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]!!! Good move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_28]And red sacrifices one chariot for a black cannon and two cross river pawns. The game would become complex and both sides would have inherent weaknesses to address.||The variation given above is but one of the many possible variations and sub variations. ||Due to the constraints of this book, it would be impossible and impractical to show all the important variations.||Jim: A slightly old book with detailed discussions into this opening would be《象棋攻防战术》by Master Yan Mujiang 言穆江大师. That book was published way back in the 80's but is a very good read! And this was recommended by an unknown person from the internet from which this file was based upon. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_28]
