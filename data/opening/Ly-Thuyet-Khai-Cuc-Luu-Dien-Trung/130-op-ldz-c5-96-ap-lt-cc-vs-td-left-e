[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c5 96 ap lt cc vs td left e||第96局进兵对卒底炮红右中炮黑左象 ||||ECCO：E16 仙人指路轉左中炮對卒底炮飛右象||ECCO：E16 Angel's Pawn with Left Central Cannon vs Thundering Defense with Right elephant||||Jim: There is a discrepancy in the nomenclature of ECCO. ECCO starts with P3+1 which is a mirror image of this.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Black answers with the left black elephant, This was very fashionable way back in the 70's and is still seen now and then in actual competition.||Compared with the right elephant variation, it is much less played but from the standpoint of opening theory, there is greater potential for the left elephant. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]It is not advisable to play P1+1 now or red would have a significant lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red adopts a more steadfast approach with this move.||If red decides to start attacking with H9+8, the game would most probably develop into a complex variation with both sides having their areas of concern.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Other than this move, black could also consider R4+4. It would probably lead to an even game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And it would be a relatively even game.||Summary:||The key issue in this opening is the ability of red to organize his left flank for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]And it would be relatively even.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]And red would have the attack but black would have more pawns. These issues would have to be addressed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]And red would have a significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
