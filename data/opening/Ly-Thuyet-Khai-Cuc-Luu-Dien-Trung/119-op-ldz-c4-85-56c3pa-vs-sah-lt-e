[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 85 56c3pa vs sah lt e||第85局五六炮三兵对反宫马左象 ||||ECCO：B45 五六炮左邊馬對反宮馬||ECCO：B45 56 Cannons with side elephant vs Sandwiched Horse Defense.||Jim: The GM had chosen to classify his cc openings and sah counters according to which elephant was moved by black. ||In the previous board and this one, black has chosen to play E7+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]After playing the palcorner cannon, red's opening has become the 56 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs the Sandwiched Horse Defense with left elephant variation.||This opening was once very popular in the mid 80's, but has gradually declined in usage in the recent years.||In this variation, the tempo of the game is slow and most of the time, the game would become a standoff.||Red would choose to develop his pieces into his ideal formation before starting to attack, thereby  slowing the pace of the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Red would still be in the lead if black chose to play the riverbank cannon with C2+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black might consider the following two options:||1. R9=8 --> red would have the lead firmly in hand||2. C2=7 --> red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]This is a good move for red to try to increase his lead![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]If black chose to play R9=7 to protect the horse, red would hold the lead firmly in position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]And red would not only be up material-wise, red would also have better positioning.||In Summary:||The 56c with 3rd pawn advancement variation versus  the sandwiched horse defense with left elephant variation is a relatively less complex opening. The pace of the game would also be slower and would allow red to control the game better. ||However, statistical analysis would seem to show that red's efficiency is not that desirable (Jim: that is the game ends in a draw easily). ||The key point in this opening is the mobility of the left red chariot. Its speed of development would have profound effects on the entire game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]And red would hold the lead firmly in hand![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]And red would have the lead firmly in hand.||Jim: The main reason is that black's horses are still at the bottom rank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]Red CANNOT play P5+1 or black would seize control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]Jim: For beginners, red cannot accept the horse sacrifice. I have added a few moves to show why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]Perhaps playing A6+5 would be better now.||jim: this was what was said in the manual. there were no explanations why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]And all hell would break lose for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]And black would have seized control of the game from red![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]
