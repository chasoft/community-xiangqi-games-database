[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 24 cc7paprr vs sch7pa rt a e C31 02||第24局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马右士象（2）  ||||ECCO：C31 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬上士||ECCO C31 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and Right Advisor Variation ||Red goes for H8+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Jim: This is the variation discussed in this board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Red could also choose to play C8=9 or R2=3, both of which would lead to very complex variations. Please see the variations listed below.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black chooses to chase away the horse with this move.||Click on the variation to see what would happen if black tried R1=4 instead. ||Jim: There might have been a printing error for the moves given in the R1=4 variation. click on and you would understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This is the correct order of moves. ||Playing R1=4 by black now would help red to simply play P5+1! to attack. Red would be better off then![/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red thinks far ahead with this move.||Another possible variation would be R9+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red would have the advantage.||If black tried H3+4 on the next move, red would simply play C8+7 for the check and would then be attacking an empty right black flank. Red's gain would be even more. ||In summary,||H7+6 is a more steadfast option for red, allowing red better control of the game. In this variation, the key issue for red is to maneuver the left red horse correctly and develop the left red chariot at the right time. Red would be able to control the game under most circumstances.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red is much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_15]Jim: The moves that follow are listed in the book but are questionable. ||Proceed at your own risk! LOL. ||Perhaps C8+2 would be more reasonable...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_16]Jim: This is where the controversy continues. Black could have simply played R4+4 and be much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]???[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]???[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]Jim: This was the move given in the book. But it is interesting as to why red would not play H6+4...||Unfortunately, no other explanations was given.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]Red would be better with the cross river pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]Jim: The moves that follow were presented by someone over the net which makes the moves more reasonable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]And red would be better with the cross river pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]And it would become a sticky situation for both sides. There are areas of concern to address for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]In this variation, red gains material but black has the say in attack.||Quite even.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
