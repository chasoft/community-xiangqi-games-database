[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 37 cc7fh vs sch 2prc 01||第37局中炮七路马对屏风马双炮过河 ||Jim: Well, here you have it, the only file in the GM's book discussing this very volatile opening. And the GM is one of the experts on this opening.||I have uploaded a series of files discussing this opening under the ECCO C04 section. Please go to the menu bar on the left and click on the respective ECCO variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red has two other alternatives.||Please click on the variations to view them.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]As can be seen from the diagram, this is the famous (or rather infamous) opening: Red's central cannon with 7th filed horse vs Black's Screen Horse defense with double pawn ranked cannon variations. ||Black's opening began with C2+4 (right pawn ranked  cannon) and was already very very popular throughout China back in the 1920's. From there, many exciting variations evolved but not many could stood the test of time. However, those that survived evloved further, with new variations and modifications replacing old ones. This could be said to represent the progress of mankind's thought.||This variation has still much room for development and awaits the bold to furhter enrich it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]R9+1 is the main counter that red would normally use.||There are two other choices.||Please click in the variation to see them!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]This is the modern day way of playing this variation for black. ||Black's cannon forces red to move E7+9 before using the chariot to aim at the left red cannon. This move has effectively replaced older ways of playing this opening like E3+5 as red could play R9=4/R9=6.||It must be mentioned that black's E3+5 followed by  red's R9=6/R9=4 was very fashionable for over 2 decades before black came up with this move.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]R9=4 was once tried before...[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]In the past, R2+6 was played.||This is the improvment made over R2+6.||Please click on the variation to see the R2+6 variation.　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]R6+5 would result in red surrendering the control of the game to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And black advances the cannon for a skewer.||This move effectively pushes the game into an even more complex situation.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Correct move to play. H7+5 now would be met by red's C8+4 and red would win instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]C5+3 now would give the game to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Red would be killed if he got greedy and played R6=4 to take the horse now![/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And black has seized control of the game from red.||In summary,||the double pawn ranked cannon variation of the screen horses is a very very volatile and complex variation. Be it red or black, the room for error is minimal and a slight mistake would end the game.||Red would have a hard time trying to maintain the lead in the game, and that is why in recent years, red would prefer not to play this variation and this opening has declined.||However, there are still examples of bold and creative inprovisions to this opening in the recent years.||The first man to have eaten crabmeat must have marveled at this delicacy. But those who followed suit and boldy pressed on would also deserve our respect!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_44]And red's chariot, no matter how hard they try, will not be able to resolve black's impending iron-bolt checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_42]And this would turn into a bloody fistfight. Black would have the easier time though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]And red is sure to win now![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]And red has gained nothing in the exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]And red would be faster in the attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_29]Red is better as there is a cross river pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]C5=4 is another possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_28]And it would become a 'sticky' game whereby both sides would have immediate areas of concern to address.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]And red's chariot has actually got in the way of his elephant.||Black has the material advantage and is on the winning end of things![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]Black's pieces have managed to form a blockade, and controlled the important files and ranks. Black has seized control of the game from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_22]And black is better because of the greater mobility of his chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]And it would be a relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_18]An equal game for both sides, which black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_18]
