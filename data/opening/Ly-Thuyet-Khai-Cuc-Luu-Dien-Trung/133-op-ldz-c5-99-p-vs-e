[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c5 99 p vs e||第99局进兵对飞象 ||||ECCO：E01 仙人指路對飛象||ECCO：E01 Angel's Pawn vs Elephant opening[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Playing the elephant to counter the Angel's Pawn was once very popular but had gradually declined in use. Perhaps this was because red can metamorphosize in to many various variations in different opening systems and therefore, black would have to prepare many different counters.||As seen from the diagram, other than the palcorner, red could also choose to play the following:||1) H8+7 --> and it would lead to an even game||2) C8=5 --> and both sides would change to other opening systems and counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red makes this move in advance, discouraging black from playing H8+7. If black does make the move, red would play C2=3.||Other than this move, red could also play:||1) C2=5 --> red would hold on to the slight lead||2) H2+3 --> and it would be an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And to prevent red from playing C2=3 to limit the development of the horse, black counters with this move.||If black insisted on playing H8+7, red would have the small lead.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And red would hold on to the lead.||Summary:||The variations given in this example have been condensed from many actual games played by various experts. There is still much room for study.||However, it would seem that using the elephant to counter the pawn opening would result in black having a slower development of the chess pieces. ||Perhaps, black should choose other more efficient formations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_17]And red would have the slight lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]And red is slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]And it would be an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_9]Red could also play C2=5 and the opening would metamorphosize in to the 59 Cannons with 7th filed horse vs the Screen Horse Defense with Right elephant variation. ||Jim: Such is the versatility of the pawn opening. Please go to the section in chapter 2 for this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]And it is basically an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]And after a few round, red's formation is basically the Central Cannon with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs the Sandwiched horse defense (mirror image of the default variation whereby C2=5 is played as the first move).[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]And red would have lost his lead by default.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]
