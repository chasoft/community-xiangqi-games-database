[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 79 odc 02||第79局列手炮局（2）  ||||ECCO：D50 中炮對列炮||ECCO：D50 Central Cannon vs Opposite direction cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]With this move, black plays the Small Variation of the ODC. It is one of the popular openings that still has a large following even today.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Red advances this chariot to launch his attack. This red pawn ranked chariot would now limit the space of black's left flank.||H8+7 would lead to another variation. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Accepting the exchange is a more stoic variation.||If red chose R2=3, black would counter with R8+2 but red would still hold on to the lead in most of the variations to come.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]If red played :||1) R9+1 --> black would have a more explosive counter-attack||2) C5+4 --> and red would give the control of the game to black![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Playing H8+7 is not advisable as red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red's riverbank horse is already very well positioned and can choose to attack or defense as needed. ||Red now retreats the cannon to fine tune his formation into a better one.||Although red has fewer pawns, red is in full control of the game, and this would prove very important as the game progresses.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red has fewer pawns but has the lead in the game firmly in control.||In summary,||the difference between the small variation and the big variation of the odc is that the small variation is more benign and has more room for error. The big variation is very volatile and anything could happen if a slight mistake were made.||Under most instances, if red were able to develop his chess pieces evenly, and play firmly to have the game tightly controlled, red would have an efficient opening that would proceed into midgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And red would have the significant advantage.||Black would be in a dilemma whether to accept the exchange or not.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_20]Black has a more powerful counter ready to spring.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]And black is better and is actually in the lead now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]And red would still be much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]And red's chariot has been limited in movement.||This is another MAJOR variation.||||Jim: Often, the moves played by black are not the same. This is the left cannon blockade counter by black. It is still one very commonly played opening and is one big topic on opening theory by itself. More can be seen in the few boards on this topic that I have uploaded in the past.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
