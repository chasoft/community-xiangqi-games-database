[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 22 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C49||第22局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红中兵七路炮型  ||||ECCO：C49 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C49 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Red advances the cental pawn across the river and plays the 7th file cannon![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is the variation discussed in this board.||Red charges the pawn across the river first, waits for black to play the advisor, before making this move. ||This was once very fashionable back in the 1960's.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]In the beginning, black would often answer with H7+8 but most of the time, red would hold on to the control of the game as play progressed.||Then, black discovered a powerful counter: sacrificing the 7th file pawn.||After sacrificing the 7th pawn, red's pawn rank would be open for attack by black's chariot (R8+6) and black could easily add pressure on red's 3rd file.||And that is why red would not play C8=7 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]P7+1 was tried in the past but black would simply counter with R8=3!||Jim: Pls click on the variation to see !　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]C2+3 is another viable option for black.||Jim: Click on the variation to see![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Black would still be able to have a say in the game if red chose to play E3+1 instead of this move.||Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black cannot be greedy and play R8+2! Red would simply sacrifice that horse for a seething attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And it would be a very tense game.||There are immediate concerns for both sides to address, but black has now concentrated four major pieces on red's right flank. Black is better now. ||In summary, ||in this variation, red chooses to advance the central pawn before playing C8=7. It would seem to be a waste of moves and not in accordance of red's intention of attacking the center. ||Black's 7th file pawn sacrifice is brilliant! It not only resolves red's P7+1 attack but also gives black many options for a counter as the game progresses!||This is one solid variation for black to use against red![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]Jim: Gluttony, one of the seven sins...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And for the price of one horse, red has an attack going on now. Black is in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]And black can be satisfied with the outcome of things.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]And although black has sacrificed a horse, black would now have control of the game. This is a viable option for black![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]And black is much better!||Jim: All the black pieces are well developed and red has wasted too many moves moving the pawn. The pressure on red's left flank is also nearly unbearable![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]And red would gain back lost material to have the say in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_18]Variation played in the earlier times![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]And red would gain back the lost material and have the pawn advantage.||Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]
