[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 55 cc5paprr vs sch7pa||第55局中炮急进过河车对屏风马7卒直横车对右炮逐车  ||Red uses the filed and ranked chariot for attack while black plays C2+1 to chase away the red filed chariot.||||ECCO：C23 中炮過河車七路馬對屏風馬兩頭蛇||ECCO：C23 Central Cannon with Pawn ranked chariot with 7th Filed horse vs Screen Horse Defense with Double headed snake pawn formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]As can be seen from the diagram, red's P3+1 has been the move that has been played very often by red players.||In the past, red tried P7+1 but statistical evidence would show that black would be able to do well in that variation and that is why it has gradually fallen out of favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]C2+1 is another alternative but red would have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Instead of immediately playing R9=2 to pin black's chariot and cannon, red makes this move first.||This is to force black to move C2-1 to protect his  horse. After that is done, red would not have to fear black playing H6-8!||Red could also consider moving P7+1. Red would probably gain material, but black would be the aggressor in that variation. 　||Jim: I added a variation c to show what the GM meant in his first comment.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]This is a less violent, more stable choice from red. Red decides to change his formation to allow for better defense.||If red chose to attack with C8-1, black would sacrifice material to have an attack.||Red would also gain material if he accepted black's sacrifice with R7+3 but black's ensuing attack would be seething.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]If red chose to play H3+4 instead, black would counter with C8+3![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Good move!!!||This would force red to advance his palcorner cannon, thereby disrupting red's defensive formation, causing instability and unrest.||This is a must make move before black plays C2-4!||It would be much better than playing C2-4 immediately.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And red would still hold on to a slight lead in the game.||Thus far, all of the major pieces for both sides are intact and both have decent formations.||The real fight in this variation is in the midgame and endgame which requires skills in this stages. The outcome would still take some time before it can be decided.||In summary:||red's rapid R2+6 with left proper horse and left ranked chariot variation has developed into an important and huge variation of the central cannon when faced with the screen horse defense with double headed snake pawn formation.||It is impossible to introduce or point out the intricacies with just a few boards. The best way the beginner can learn is through actual play and practice so that one could learn the intricacies more. There are many tactics to be used also in this opening. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]And red is forced to use his chariot to exchange for black's two pieces.||Black would earn more in this bargain.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_36]And after black's sacrifice, black has an nice attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]And although black is down material wise, he has a vicious attack going on.||Jim: At the expense of a horse, black gets to gain an elephant and also concentrate at least 1r2c on red's weak left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]And it would be a relatively even game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_38]And although red would have more material, it is black who is attacking. ||Both sides would have their qualms regarding this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]Jim: Just to show what would happen if red played R9=2 immediately.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]Jim: That is why red played R9=4 first before moving R4=2, instead of moving R9=2.||Black is sure to gain a chariot now and losing a chariot so early in the game would mean that red's  prospects look bleak.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]Please click on the variation to see what would happen if red accepted black's sacrifice...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_37]And red would be the aggressor, holding the lead firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]And both players would have their worries.||Jim: But it would seemed that black is the aggressor in this scenario.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]"Older" variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]And black would still be able to hold his own against red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]
