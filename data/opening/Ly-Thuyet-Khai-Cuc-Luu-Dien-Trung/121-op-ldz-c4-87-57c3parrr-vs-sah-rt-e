[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 87 57c3parrr vs sah rt e||第87局五七炮三兵横车对反宫马右象 ||||ECCO：B34 中炮右橫車對反宮馬||ECCO：B34 Central Cannon with right ranked chariot vs Sandwiched horse defense[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Playing P3+1 now has been quite fashionable the past few years, and it allows red more options as the game progresses.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And black counters with P3+1 of his own. This is to ensure that this horse gets adequate development.||If black chose to play R8+7...　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Playing C8=7 now is another option.||Red would still hold on to a small lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Since red has played the ranked chariot, black should not play H8+7 now or red would increase his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Playing C2+4 is not advised as red would increase his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Black should not play H3+4 or red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]This is a good move by red to try to increase his lead in the game now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]And red is signicantly better.||Summary:||The above shown opening is quite a new one and there is much room for study. It is quite promising too.||In this opening, red's right chariot gets development relatively later into the game. The most important factor in this variation is the speed of development of the chariots and their ability to control the important points on the board.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]And red is significantly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]And red threatens to play R4=8 on the next move.||Black would be in a dilemma then.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]　　红方占优。[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_8]This variation will be discussed in the next board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_8]
