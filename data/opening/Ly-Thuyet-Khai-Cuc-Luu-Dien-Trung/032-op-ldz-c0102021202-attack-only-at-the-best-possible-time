[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102021202 attack only at the best possible time　||||The central pawn advancement and central linked horses variation of the central cannon is considered to be one of the more aggressive variations for red.||However, if black has the possibility of moving a central cannon of his own, it would not be advisable for red to advance the central pawn too early.||As can be seen in this example, if red played C2+5 now, black would counter with C2=5 and red would be in deep trouble.||That is why it would be advisable for red to play R1=6 now. If black chose to counter with H2+3 for the screen horse defense, black would now be unable to play C2=5 and red could safely continue with his original intentions of P5+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Not advised.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Black would have a very strong counter attack going on now. Red would have lost control of the game to black.||The main reason for this is that red had charged the central pawn too early, which prompted black to counter with C2=5. The central pawn became a target for attack instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]Suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]And red would now be able to start attacking the center as he had originally intended too.||Black would not be able to counter so quickly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
