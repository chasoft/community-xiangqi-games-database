[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020102 Pay attention to efficiency||||In the opening stages, the efficiency of the moves is an especially prominent problem. Only through repetitive learning and analyses, with a target specific approach will one improve.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]In this example, red has started the opening with the side horse variation of the central cannon.||Black has countered with the screen horse defense.||The moves prior to this move are okay.||However, black's P1+1 is questionable.||The main idea behind P1+1 is to inhibit the red side horse. However, it is inferior to playing P7+1 as it black would not only allow his horse to be developed, it would inhibit the developement of the black horse in the same file. ||The efficiency of the moves can only often be seen appreciated after comparison the various alternatives for the same move.||Jim: The side horse would not seem to be as big a threat as the proper horse now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
