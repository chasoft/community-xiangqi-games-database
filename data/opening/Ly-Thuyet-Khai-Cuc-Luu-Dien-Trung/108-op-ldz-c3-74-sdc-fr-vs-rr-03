[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Playing the left proper horse is a major improvement in the development of this opening.||It was pioneered by GM Hu RongHua back in the 1960's and after over 30 years of fine tuning, it has become an orthodox variation which many complex variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]P3+1 is a farsighted move that is played as a continuation of H8+7.||P7+1 is another variation.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]As can be seen from the diagram, H2+1 is introduced in this major variation.||R4+5/R4+4/H2+3/P3+1 are all other possible alternatives.||Due to the scope of this book, R4+4 is introduced here. ||Please click on the variation to see.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]If black were to play R4+7, red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]In the past C2=3 was played and red would have an attack as the game progressed. This move is an improvision of that.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black cannot attack the advisor rashly with C4+7 as red would have the significant advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And red is better!||In summary, after red's cannon has captured the central pawn with C4+4, red not only has gained material, it has also increased his lead with the number of effective moves played.||As long as red holds on to the advantage bestowed by his central cannon, he should be able to achieve a desirable opening in this variation going into midgame. This is also a very versatile opening, allowing red to both attack and defend at the same time. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]And red gains a cross river pawn. Red has the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]And red has a nice attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]And red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]And red is better.||Jim: Red will play C8=3 on the next possible move. The change in formation allows red to focus his attack on black's left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]Jim: hmm, this variation was not found in the original book. either this was from an earlier version or someone from the internet added it. ||The moves looks ok.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
