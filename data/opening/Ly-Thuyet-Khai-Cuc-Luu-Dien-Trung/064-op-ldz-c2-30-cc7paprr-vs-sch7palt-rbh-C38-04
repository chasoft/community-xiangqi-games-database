[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 30 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C38 04||第30局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红高左炮型平车保马 ||ECCO：C38 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C38 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation||Jim: Another important variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Using the cannon to protect red's own pawn rank and to limit black's rivernbank horse was very popular in the 1960's. This is known as the "high left cannon" variation or “高左炮”in Chinese. ||It is also a very complex, very aggressive variation, and not commonly seen in other openings. ||As openings nowadays tend to be more variable, most players would prefer to try to keep control of the game firmly in hand, hence this variation became less used. ||Jim: the xq players, they have mouths to feed too![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]As seen in this diagram, black chooses to counterattack immediately by pushing the pawn foward. This would sound the horn for battle as both sides would now go at it.||There are many more options for black to choose from, some of which are shown in the variations given||Jim: click on the variations below and you will see them. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]C5=4 is another viable option leading to a rather even game. ||R4=5 would give the game to black!||Jim: Please click on the variations below to understand!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]A very aggressive move from Red!||R9=8 is another volatile option.||Jim: Click on the variation to see![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This is one of the better moves for black.||Instead of waiting, black tries to wrestle for the leadin the game with this sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]If black chose C7=5, it would be a scathing attack by both sides![/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And it would be an attacking game for both but black would seem to have a better time.||In summary, this is a very aggressive variation with very complex subvariations and little room for error. Due to the context of this book,only  the major variations are shown here only.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]And both sides would be at it![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]Black would sacrifice material to have an attack in this variation![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]And although black is down materialy-wise, Black has a very power attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]A viable option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]Not advisable!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]And red would not have any significant advantage!||Black can live with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]And red is slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_37]Red is much better off. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]Red would have the material advantage and also the positional advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_29]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_29]
