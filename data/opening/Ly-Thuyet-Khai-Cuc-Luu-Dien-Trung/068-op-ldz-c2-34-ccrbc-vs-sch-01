[DhtmlXQ_comment10]If black wanted to be aggressive, he could choose to play C2+4 for a very bloody variation.||The double cross river cannon variation would be examined in more detail in board 37.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And this is the topic of discussion for many more boards to come.||Red advances the left cannon for the riverbank cannon variation. And as black has played E3+5, black's opening would be the Screen Horse Opening with Right central elephant variation.||Red's riverbank cannon variation has been popular for many years, and there have been many books devoted to this opening.||As the study of opening theory slowly improved, black could have chosen to play C2+4 for the fifth move. That way, red's intention of playing the riverbank cannon and riverbank chariot would be snuffed. ||That is why, in recent years, sometimes Red would choose to play the riverbank cannon first in so that black would not have a chance to play the double cross riverbank cannon variation.||The following few boards would discuss more on this.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Other than this R1=3 move, black could also choose to play||1) C2-1||2) C8+2||3) C2+2||4) P3+1||5) C8+4 and ||6) A4+5.||There is a chinese saying “巡河九应”which means that the riverbank cannon has many counters.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is target specific counter from red. It is perhaps the best move to counter R1=3.||If red chose to be rash and played P3+1, it would be black's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black could also choose to play C8+2 or H3-5. ||H3-5 will be introduced.||Jim: Please click on the variation below.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Playing C2=4 would be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And it would be a rather even game.||In summary , the riverbank cannon variation can be thought of as a slow attacking variation with great versatility. In some variations, it could be an attacking game while it could be more of on balanced development.||In this opening, the ability to deploy your forces  quickly and accurately is key. And that is why it is good for beginners to learn this opening, as one would learn how to use the pieces better just by studying this opening.||It is also very helpful for beginners as it would help one to understand more about opening theory.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]And red has a very power attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]And the black chariot has been developed vey well. Black is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And it would be a attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_19]And Red would still be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]Red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]And red has the significant advantage!||Jim: Red can now choose to play C7=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]And after the sacrifice, red has a seething attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]Red is better as black is cramped.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_10]Black could also make this move instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_12]And black's opening would be the infamous Screen Horse Defense with Double Pawn Ranked Cannon variation.||Jim: I have uploaded a whole series of boards on this variation. Please go to the ECCO page to see it. And I used to call it the double cross river cannon variation which is a direct translation of the chinese name for it. However, the double pawn ranked cannon variation may be more suitable, but I still prefer the double cross river cannon variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_12]
