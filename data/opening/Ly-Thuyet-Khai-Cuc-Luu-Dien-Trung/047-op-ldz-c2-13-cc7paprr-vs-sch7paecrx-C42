[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 13 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C42||第13局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型肋车捉炮（6） ||||ECCO：C42 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C42 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: This is the last board whereby red plays the 59 cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]This is a subtle move by red, deliberately tempting black to play P7+1.||This variation started in the mid 1980's and has become one of the major variations.||There are three options for black which are dealt with in the next move.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This move is one that has been extensively studied  by many, and is one of the best counters that black can have.||The idea is to limit the red left chariot, and adopt a wait and see approach.||Click on the variation to see what would happen if black chose P7+1 or C2+5 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]C2-2 would push the game toward a bloody fistfight. Red would have better control though. Click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Black has the material advantage but red has more pawns. Each has his worries.||Black can continue with R8+8 or R8+3, and the battle would wage on.||In summary, when red plays R8-5 in move 12 as a tempt, black cannot play P7+1 or he would fall into red's trap. C2+7 would allow black to hold his own in the game though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And both sides would be attacking with ferocity.||Red would have the easier time though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]Red is better after the sacrifice. This variation  would suit  Red's gameplan better.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]Red is better in terms of formation and mobility of the pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]
