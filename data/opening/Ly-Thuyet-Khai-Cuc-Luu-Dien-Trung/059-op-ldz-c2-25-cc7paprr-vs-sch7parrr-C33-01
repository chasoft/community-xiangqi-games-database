[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 25 cc7paprr vs sch7parrr C33 01||第25局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马横车   ||||ECCO：C33 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬右橫車||ECCO C33 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and Right Ranked Chariot ||||Jim: Another big big topic in the screen horse defense. Please note that this variation is different from the example discussed in Board 14 and 15 whereby the ranked chariot is played AFTER the edge cannon for chariot exchange variation.||In this variation, black goes for the right ranked chariot variation early.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And black raises the right ranked chariot. This variation was very very popular in the 60's. One of the main ideas was to seal off all possible escape routes of the red pawn ranked chariot. In virtue of this tactic, it is considered to be one of the faster paced openings.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]As seen from the diagram, red chose to play the left proper horse variation. ||C8=7 is another often played variation. ||Please click on the variation to understand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]If red chose C8=9, it would be an all out attack by both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]It would be inadvisable to play R9=8 now, as black would gain the lead from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And it would be a relatively even game for both sides. ||It would be a drawish game if Red continued with C5+3 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And this would basically be a drawish situation. 　In summary, in this sort of opening, red would have a huge advantage of the game if the left chariot were able to be developed. However, if red attacked too recklessly, black could easily counter viciously.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]And black gets to concentrate his forces and adjust his formation. The black pieces are now threatening. Black now has the say in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]And both sides would be attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]And it would be a relatively even game. Red would still hold on to a small lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
