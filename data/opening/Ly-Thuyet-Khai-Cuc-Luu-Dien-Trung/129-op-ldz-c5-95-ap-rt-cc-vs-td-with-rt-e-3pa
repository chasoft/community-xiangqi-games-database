[DhtmlXQ_comment6]This is another major variation in this opening system.||Black aims for practical gains first but would sometime slow the development of his other pieces.||It has its pros and cons when compared to the R9+1 variation (previous board).[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Playing P3+1 first before this R9+1 has been a major improvision over the past few years.||The ranked chariot is prepared to move to the other side of the board to add pressure to red's left flank.||In the past H2+4 was played but red would usually have the upper hand as the game progressed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]R2+4 is another viable possibility with red maintaining his slight lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]If red chose to play C5+4, black would still be able to counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]A4+5 is another viable possibility.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Playing the cannon to capture the two pawns would allow red to gain material upperhand (which could prove to be instrumental in the endgame), but this is done at the expense of developing the other chess pieces.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Offering an exchange of chariots would give black a breather and slow red's attack.||C8=7 by black now would give red substantial gains.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Playing the cannon would allow black to prepare to charge P7+1.||Playing H4+2 would give red the advantage.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]And red would be slightly better off.||Summary:||This variation would often proceed to midgame with red holding on to a slight lead.||Therefore, it would be a test of a player's midgame skills when this variation is played as the real battle would be in the midgame, and not in the opening. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]At this point in thime, red could choose to play :||1) C8=6 ||2) R2+4.||But in both variations, red would not gain much and black would be able to counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]And it could still be anybody's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]no!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]And red would gain material![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]And black would still be able to ward off red's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]And black would be able to protect his precious pawn on the 3rd rank indirectly.||It could be anybody's game.||Jim: For beginners, I added a few moves to show what would happen if red played H9+7 ..[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And black would threaten to checkmate with C7+3.||Red would thus lose his horse and black would have  gained material gain so early in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]And red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]And red would have the significant upper hand!||Jim: Red's pieces are all very well developed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]
