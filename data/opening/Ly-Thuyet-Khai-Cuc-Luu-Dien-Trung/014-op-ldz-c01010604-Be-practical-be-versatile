[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c01010604 Be practical be versatile||||XiangQi is a vibrant game which seems to have a life of its own. It is able to constantly renew and evolutionize itself. ||That is why there is a saying"譜不盡弈之變,法不可進戰之奇" (Jim: which would roughly translate to " chess manuals are not able to cover all the variations and no one strategy is sufficient for actual play). ||There are tens of thousands of variations in XiangQi and that is subjective fact and these variations keep bringing new ones. That is why the XiangQi player should never just stick to one strategy.||When faced with unfamiliar openings or variations, often, your pre-planned targets or goals are often unachievable. ||Playing in an unfavorable situation is also part and parcel of your journey into the world of XiangQi.||That is why, the beginner must grasp the principles well and be practical. All that he has learnt should be put to test in actual battle and these principles, strategies and tactics should be used in a versatile manner. ||Never be stuck with one strategy only, but change your game plan in accordance to the actual situation on the board and your opponent.||The same thing applies to your opening. Never play only one variation, and repeating the same moves over and over again, or your opponent would be able to counter very precisely and thus affect the efficiency of your moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
