[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102021101 the order of the moves made||XiangQi is a game whereby the order of the moves made can make a whole world of a difference. ||For example, if the moves to be made should have been a-->b-->c-->d, but d--> c --> a -->b was played instead, the entire game would be different and often, there would be drastic consequences to bear. One must be very careful with the order of moves made.||In this example, red has played the central cannon with 7th filed horse variation. Black has answered with the screen horse defense.||Black to move.||Playing C2+4 would lead to drastically different outcomes when compared to playing C8+4 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Not advisable...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Not only has black NOT been able to get both cannons to red's pawn rank for the Double Pawn Ranked Cannons variation, black's effort with the left cannon blockade has also been spoilt by red.||||In summary, the order of the moves made is heavily dependent on the ability of the player's understanding of the opening, and it would have drastic consequences on the game. This is one area that the beginner MUST pay special attention too.||||Jim: Please compare this outcome with playing C2+4 in the other variation for move one.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]Advised move.||If red played C5+1, black would immediately counter with C8+4![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]And black would be able to play the dreaded Double Pawn Ranked Cannons Variation of the Screen Horse Defense. This is a time proven counter to the central cannon. ||Jim: Please go to the GM lectures on this variation in the book. There are also a few other pages dedicated to this volatile and bloodthirsty variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
