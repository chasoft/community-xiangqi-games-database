[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0101060102 Development of the Horse||||2) Horses should have ample room for development.||The horse is considered to be a middle distanced weapon, and is less mobile than the chariot or cannon. Another weakness for the horse is that in the opening stages of the game, there are many chess pieces on the board and they can tend to get in the way of the horses. ||That is why, in the opening stages, for the development of the horse, the aim is to try to keep the line of movement of the horses as free as possible. When the time is ripe, and when there are other pieces available as backup, the horse would then charge forward into battle.||||Jim: There were no examples in the GM's book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
