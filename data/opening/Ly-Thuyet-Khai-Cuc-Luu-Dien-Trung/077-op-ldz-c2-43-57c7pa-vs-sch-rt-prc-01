[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 43 57c7pa vs sch rt prc 01||第43局五七炮七兵对屏风马右炮过河 ||||ECCO：C68 五七炮互進七兵對屏風馬||ECCO：C68 57 Cannons with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse defense with 7th Pawn Advancement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And we arrive at the basic formation of today's discussion. ||Using the 57 cannons with 7th pawn advancement to attack black's screen horse defense is an old opening which was very popular in the 1950's. However, there were several technical aspects that were unresolvable at that time and this opening gradually went into demise.||In the past few years, several players dug this opening out from the archives and made certain improvision, thereby breathing life into this opening again. And because it obtained good results, it became popular again. ||In this variation, red does not fear black's cannon from playing C2+6 (which will be discussed in the next board) and plays the 57 Cannons instead.||This is the improvision done.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Other commonly played variations include C8+2 or C2+6.||Jim: The variations are not given in the book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red starts this attack by capturing a pawn to delete black's pawn advantage.||A stoic choice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And it is a good time to offer a chariot exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Correct move to make. The central pawn must be protected even though red threatens to advance the pawn across the river.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And it would be an even game.||In summary,||the moves shown thus far can be considered to be the tabiat of this variation. ||Both sides have very stable formations and it would be very hard for either side to try to win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]And red would be much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]And red would have an increased advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]And red would be slightly better.||Jim: the game would look drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]Another commonly played variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]And after the maneuvering, red would be better!||Jim: Black has to retreat the horse now, and red would start his counter with a possible H9+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_9]In the past this was usually played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_14]And red's major chess pieces, especially the chariots would have limited room for development. ||It can be said that red would have lost the initiative in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_14]
