[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020601 NEVER gain material but lose tempo||In the opening stages, there are many chess pieces on the board, but not all of them are able to be used to their fullest potential in the early stages. Such chess pieces would not be valuable at this point in time and they would have better use in the midgame and opening. ||That is why, it is a taboo to capture 'less valuable' material, especially at the expense of a loss in tempo. ||In this example, red has chosen the Central Cannon  with 7th pawn advancement and pawn ranked chariot variation, while black has countered with the Screen horse defense with edge cannon for chariot exchange variation. ||It is red's turn to move.||One of the generally accepted plays for red would be R4-3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]But red chose to play this less commonly played variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Although black has sacrificed a horse, his cross river pawns on the 3rd and 7th files have effectively stifled the movement of the red horses.||Black has also managed to activate his right chariot while at the same time adjust the positions of his chariot-horse-pawn combination.||It is obvious that red's gain of material (black horse) is NOT worth the current position.||In the opening stages of the game, more often than not,the advantage in tempo and an advantageous postion/formation is often much more important than material gains/losses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
