[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 06 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C45||第06局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型右马归心 ||Red plays the 59 Cannons and retreats his horse early.||||ECCO：C45 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C45 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: Another more modern day variation of the 59 cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Jim: There is a slight change in the order of moves as compared to the previous boards. GM Liu will explain in a moment...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]There is a slight difference in the order of the moves leading to this one. ||Black has advanced his 7th pawn to retaliate red's 7th pawn early. That is why red would need to push his chariot across the river early, so that black would NOT be able to play the left cannon blockade variation (C8+4).||Although there is a slight change in the moves, we come back to the same topic of discussion, black's edge cannon for chariot exchange variation. 　||Jim: There are many examples on this site discussing that variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]In the previous examples, red had played C5+4 and also C9+4. ||In this board, red retreats the horse early.||This variation only started appearing not many years ago.||The idea is to soften black's attack on black's 7th file with this move. It also allows the red horses to be linked up and be developed from the left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]A "must-make" move.||And after black pushes the pawn across the river, the game is now a test of speed for both sides.||Both red and black now attack the opponent's right flank. ||This is a very important concept to keep in mind for this variation.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]R4+2 would be to black's favor!||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black continues his attack in this file after using his pawn to capture red's pawn.||C7+5 would be to red's advantage!!! 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And the game now becomes very complex, with both sides attacking.||Summary: ||Red's H3-5 is a subtle move which allows red many offensive and defensive options.||One of the characteristics of this variation is there is a period of maneuvering of the chess pieces before both sides meet head on.||And while each side is attacking one flank, his other flank is also under attack.　||Jim: Such opening variations require much more precision in the moves played as there is much less room for error. Speed is key here.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]Not advised for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]Jim: The might of the red central horse is revealed here, defending the bottom ranked elephant and preventing black from playing H6+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]And red has the advantage!||All of red's chess pieces are well developed and applying much pressure on black. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]And both sides would be in attack mode. ||Black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]Jim: I added this variation to help the beginner...||If red continued with P7+1 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]Jim: Black could choose the left cannon blockade variation.||This is another HUGE section in opening theory.||There are quite a few examples on this site under the openings section.||There is nothing wrong with red playing this variation, it is more of a preference.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]
