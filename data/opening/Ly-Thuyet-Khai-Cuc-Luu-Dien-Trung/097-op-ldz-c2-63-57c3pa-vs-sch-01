[DhtmlXQ_comment14]By playing the elephant first, black makes a slight adjustment to the order of the moves made, allowing more variability in his attacking options. ||This move is one of the more popular variations in the last few years.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]If red played H3+4 now, the moves that follow would follow the moves discussed in the previous boards.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Black would be able to hold fort if red tried R6=8 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]A steadfast option.||R6+5 now would let red increase his lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]There would be about 3 basic variations should red chosse to play H3+4 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]It would probably be a rather even game should red play H3+4 now.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And the game would be rather even.||||In summary:||After pushing P1+1, black plays the left elephant E7+5, making a slight change in the order of moves made. This variation had nice results in the 1995 National Singles Competition.||It would seem that after black had played E7+5, red's R2+4 on the next move would not seem very efficient.||There is still much room for discussion in this opening and its variation.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]A rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And it would be rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_40]And black would be much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]And it would be a rather even game, although red would seem to have the easier time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]And red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]And black would be able to hold his own in this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]And this would be basically the same variation as had been discussed in the preceding few boards.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]
