[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0101060301 Obtaining a balanced formation||||A good and balanced formation refers to an evenly balanced, logically distributed and appropriate positioning of the chess pieces such that they are able to look out for each other or support each other in times of attack.||In the opening, to achieve an ideal formation, try to achieve the following:||a) the left and right flanks should be able to help each other out,||b) chess pieces that have advanced to attack are supported and covered by others ||c) the chess pieces are well knitted, and ||d) they are able to attack and defend as one functional unit.||The relationships between the strong pieces (chariot, horse and cannon), strong pieces and weak pieces (pawns, advisors, elephants, and of course the king), pieces used in attack and defense, and the entire formation as a whole should be planned such that they are balanced.||Try not to place too much emphasis on small groups  of pieces such that weak links appear in the remaining chess pieces, or the opponent would have an obvious target to attack.||In this way, the functional efficiency of the entire formation would be greatly increased such that they are able to attack in coordiation and help each other out in defense.||Jim: In a nutshell, as the saying goes, you are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This was a game that the GM saw when amateurs played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]After 7 moves, although red had played first by default, the chariots have not been developed and the horses are stuck. ||Red has clearly violated the rule of gettting the major pieces out as quickly as possible. Although he was moving his chess pieces, he was only concerned with placing his chess pieces in a pre-determined formation, leading to his cramped situation. It would take much effort later for Red to develop his chess pieces.||In the opening, one must try to get the major pieces out as fast as possible and try to maintain a balanced situation as possible. Only when that is done, can one be able to try to control the lead as much as possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
