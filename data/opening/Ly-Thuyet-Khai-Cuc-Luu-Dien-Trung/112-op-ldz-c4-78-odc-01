[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 78 odc 01||第78局列手炮局（1） ||||ECCO：D50 中炮對列炮||ECCO：D50 Central Cannon vs Opposite direction cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]This is the basic formation today's board.||Black plays the opposite direction cannons followed by the side horse for the Big Variation. It is not used nowadays, although it has been around for many centuries, dating back to the Ming Dynasty ancient manual 《金鹏十八变》"The 18 variations of the golden orc'. It was later selected and included in "The Elegant Pastime Manual' and "The Secret in the Tangerine". ||If instead black played H8+7, it would be called the Small Variation of the ODC, and would be less volatile and more flexible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]As can be seen from the board, this was one of the more popular variations in the ancient manuals. ||Black's moves are an exact mirror image of red's.||As red moves first by default, in the ensuing battle, red would most probably hold on and extend his lead, which would accumulate to a win most of the time.||That is why this opening is seldom played nowadays.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]This is not an ideal move.||Red should have defended first with A6+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]This is the move that cost black the game.||Playing C5+4 would have probably won the game instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Checkmate. Red wins.||In summary,||in the ancient manual, the kills exhibited in this example were very exciting but were not tightly knit enough. The win could be attributed to poor defense instead of superb offense. This was one of the major characteristics of the ancient manuals. ||This board was provided so that the reader could see the evolution of the ODC. ||Jim: Nevertheless, it is remarkable that Xq had already reached the status showed in the ancient manuals so many centuries ago. And before the 1960's ( whereby Xq was studied more systematically), the various ancient manuals provided a all-in-one literature on Xiangqi. Modern day Xiangqi is heavily dependent on these ancient manuals as they are basically improvisions and fine tunings of the material persented in the ancient manuals. It is highly encouraged that the beginner at least go through most of the ancient manuals to get a feel of the game and to appreciate the kills/tactics/startegies shown.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
