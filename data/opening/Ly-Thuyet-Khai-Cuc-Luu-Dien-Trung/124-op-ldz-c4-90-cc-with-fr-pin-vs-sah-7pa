[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 90 cc with fr pin vs sah 7pa||第90局中炮直车压马对反宫马7卒 ||||ECCO：B30 中炮對反宮馬后補左馬||ECCO：B30 Central Cannon vs Sandwiched Horse Defense with late left proper horse[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Playing P7+1 now is considered to be a strategic ploy. This would prevent red from playing the various P3+1 variations.||Unfortunately, this move would also be an invitation for red to play R2+8 and thus slow the development of the black's left flank.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]As can be seen, playing the palcorner cannon is a continuation of R2+8, and is one of the newer moves that has emerged over the last few years.||In the past H8+7 was played and red would still hold on to a slightl lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]If black chose to play C2-1 now, red would have a huge advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black could also consider the following:||1) R1=4 --> and red would probably have a huge lead in the game||2) C2=1 --> red would have the advantage.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red prepares to sacrifice material first before gaining it back with this move.||P3+1 is another possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]The correct move to make!||Playing H3+5 now would fall into red's trap!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red is slightly better.||Summary:||In this variation, the moves made by both red and black are orderly and do not violate any opening theory.||This is an example of an opening tabiat.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]And red is much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]And red would still have the lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]And red would have the huge advantage!||Jim: Red has managed decrease significantly black's room to move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]And red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]R9+1 is also another possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]
