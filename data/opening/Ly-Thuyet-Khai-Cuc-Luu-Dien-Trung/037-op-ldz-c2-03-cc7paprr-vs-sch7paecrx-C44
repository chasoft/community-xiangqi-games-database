[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 03 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C44||第03局 中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红七马盘河型||Red plays the riverbank horse variation||||ECCO：C44 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C44 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: To all beginners, this is one of the most played variations in Xiangqi today. Have fun!||Please go through the previous boards for more understanding.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Retreating the cannon to the throat rank is to prepare black to play C9=7 to chase away the pesky  red chariot. This move alone gave black increased versatility and allowed black to mount a counter immediately.||Tested and proved over time, this is one of the fastest evolving openings in Xiangqi today.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black strengthens his center with this advisor move. It is one of the most played variations.||Another more volatile variation would be R1+1 whereby the game would quickly climax into a bloody fistfight. ||For that variation, please refer to boards 14 and 15.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red's horse gallops to the riverbank, preparing to  mount an attack with the red chariot already in waiting.||The riverbank horse variation is considered to be one of the more steadfast variations for attack.||Other red choices would be C8=9 which would lead to a very volatile game.||Playing H7+6 would also simply mean that red chooses stability and that he wishes to control the game better as the variations that follow allow red a better grasp of the game.||In this variation, the threat of the riverbank horse would be an issue that black has to settle immediately.||In response, black can have the following options:||1) R8+5 , 2) E3+5 , 3) E7+5 and 4) P7+1. ||And statistical evidence has shown that black's chances of an even game lies in the first variation, R8+5. The other variations would allow red better control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]By playing the cross river chariot, black signals his intentions of eliminating the threat of the riverbank horse.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]By playing this move, red allows his formation more flexibility and more choices of combinational play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And by pushing this pawn forward just in time, black tries to disrupt the barricade that red has already formed on the riverbank.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]This is a nice move from red, chasing the black chariot away and trying to wrestle the lead away from black. ||If red chose C8=9, it would be an even game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This is the suggested move.||R8=7 would allow red to capture it.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]At this stage, both sides have a decent formation for both attack and defense, with good links amongst the pieces.||This is basically an even game.||In summary: the variations that we have seen above are the work of many players over the years. Newer variations are hard to come by and this has basically become a fixed opening (or "tabiat" for International chess players). ||The beginner should try to memorize them and understand the intricacies of the moves played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]And red would capture the black chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]C8=9 variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]And it would be a relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]Variation 2: E3+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]And red would still hold on to the slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]Variation 3: E7+5[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]Red is better because red has more space to move his chess pieces, allowing himself more options to attack.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]And red would still hold the lead firmly in hand![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
