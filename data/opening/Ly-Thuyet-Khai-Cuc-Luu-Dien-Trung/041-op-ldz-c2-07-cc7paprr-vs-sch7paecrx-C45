[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 07 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C45||第07局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型左炮过河 ||Red plays the 59 Cannons and retreats his horse early.||||ECCO：C45 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C45 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: Another more modern day variation of the 59 cannons. Quite fashionable and often seen in actual play and one that is not for the faint of heart![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]This is the variation discussed in this board today.||In this variation, Red decides not to be bothered with black's 7th pawn crossing the river and be aggressive instead. ||Fighting fire with fire, red now has two chariots on black's pawn rank. This is a very volatile variation and is one of the more often played contemporary variations. Very fashionable too.||It is not for the weak hearted. The margin for error that follows would become so tiny that a minor mistake could end the game prematurely.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Click on the variation below to understand what would happen if Red played R4-1.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Click on the variation to see what would happen if  black insisted on H7+8...　[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Please click on the variation below to see what might happen if black chose to play R8+4 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Playing this move instead of H7+6 is a plan to make things even more complicated.||Jim: Click on the variation to see what would happen if red chose H7+6 instead..||Jim2: In Xiangqi, when the game gets more complicated, there would be more chances to increase your lead or more opportunities to explore. The flip side of the coin would be true too. And as this variation is bent on a blitzkrieg  attack from move 11 (this variation), this is a natural continuation of red's plans.||Both sides are now walking on a thin ice now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And this is one of the best possible counters to red's aggressions. It is also proactive and promises to push the game to a climax soon.||If black became soft and played H3-4 instead ... the variations that follow would be to red's favor.||Jim: Well , just click on the variation!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]Please click on the variation below to see what would happen if red chose P7=8 instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Please click on the variation to see the fireworks that would happen if red chose R4-1 instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Both sides have their areas of concerns to address now.||Although the pace of the game has slowed down a little bit, the variations that follow are still complex.||For black, the weak center is a cause of concern. Black can only make up for this weakness with the superior positioning of his left chariot-horse-cannon-pawn combination. ||The fight would still continue and black can be satisfied with this outcome.||In summary:||In this variation, red's attack comes in wave after wave and so does black's defense. For both red and black, this variation can be an option in competition. ||Another important lesson to be learnt in this opening is the way black advances his cannon to attack the chariot from behind. The other moves that black plays from his right flank (red's left) are the key to his survival.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]Jim: for beginners, the red horse is poisoned.||Black cannot take the horse![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]Jim: for beginners, the pawn is poisoned.||I have added the variation to explain why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]Although black is down material wise, the positions of all the chess pieces are better and much easier to maneuver.||Advantage to black![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_58]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]And black would gain more material now![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_50]Jim: I added this variation to help beginners understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]Jim: And red not only gains material, the cross river pawn is protected and red would now prepare to concentrate his forces on black's empty flank, just down the road...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]This, ladies and gentlemen, is the key move in this subvariation.||It is also the biggest nightmare that red can have. Without this move, black would still be on the receiving end of things![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]And although red has captured one more elephant, black's 7th pawn now poses a dead threat. The black pieces are now also very lively. Black would be better in comparison!||All this can be attribted to black's E5+3 move at move 17 of this variation and is the basis of this opening. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]And red has captured the elephant, together with much room to maneuver. Black is in bad shape.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]And black would be able to hold his own against red's aggression.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_31]And red would have a significant advantage.||Red would be prepared to play C9=5 on the next move to control the center![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_30]According to the Chinese rules, black is threatening to capture the chariot with consecutive moves while red is only threatening to capture the chariot on every alternate moves. In this scenario, BLACK must change his moves or be penalized.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_30]And it would be a cutthoroat battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_30]
