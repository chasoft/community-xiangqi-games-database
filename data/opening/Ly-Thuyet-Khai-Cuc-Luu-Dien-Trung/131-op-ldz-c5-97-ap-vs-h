[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c5 97 ap vs h||第97局进兵对起马 ||||ECCO：E08 兩頭蛇對進右馬||ECCO：E08 Double headed snake pawns vs Right Proper Horse[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Using the Horse opening to counter the pawn opening has become a fashionable.||When faced with this counter, red would often advance the other pawn.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]A commonly played variation.||Black could also choose to move:||1) R9+1 --> red would hold on to the lead.||2) C2=3 --> red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Red could also choose to move the following moves:||1) H2+3 --> red would still be control||2) H2+1 --> red would hold on to a small lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]If black tried P3+1 now, red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]P7+1 would give control of the game to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]And it would be a basically even game.||Summary;||Red advances the 3rd and 7th pawn forward in the first two moves. This would have the effect of adding pressure on black. However, red must be careful not to allow black to exchanges chess pieces or sacrifice pawns in order to gain control of the tempo of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_18]Red has wasted 4 moves in moving the pawn forward, only to be lost after the pawn is captured. ||In the process, black gets to manipulate chess pieces and adjust his formation. The efficiency of black's moves is very high while red's is not desirable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]Red would have increased his lead in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]Red would still hold on to the lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]And red is slightly better.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_9]And red would hold the lead firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]And red would still have the lead firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
