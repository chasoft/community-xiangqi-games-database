[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102021001 be keenly aware of spatial issues　　||The issue of room to maneuver the chess pieces is one important point to take note off throughout the entire game. ||As the amount of material is greatest in the opening stages, this issue is exceptionally important.||This may be a vague concept, but simply said, "space" would refer to the files/ranks that are controlled by various chess pieces, and where these chess pieces could exert their influence on the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red has started the game with the central cannon with the 7th pawn advancement variation. Black has  countered with the left cannon blockade.||And this counter has stood the test of time. After 40 years of usage in actual competition, it has proved to be a competent counter to the central cannon. ||C8+4 is the soul of this counter as it not only creates space for black's chess pieces on the left flank, it also oppressed and limited the room for movement of red's right chariot and horse. This is perhaps the most important reason for this counter being able to stand the test of time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
