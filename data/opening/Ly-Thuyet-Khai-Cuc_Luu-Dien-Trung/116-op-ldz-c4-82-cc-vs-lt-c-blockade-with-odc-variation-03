[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 82 cc vs lt c blockade with odc variation 03||第82局中炮对左炮封车转列炮（3）  ||||ECCO：D34 中炮進三兵對左炮封車轉列炮||ECCO：D34 Central Cannon with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Left cannon blockade with ODC variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]This is a very new variation from red.||The advangtages of this variation is that red gets  to develop his pieces evenly and is a slower paced game. It is also very easy for this variation to evolve into a chariotless midgame/endgame as both chariots are often exchanged.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red should not play R9=8 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Red prepares to link the elephants after retreating the cannon.||If red were to rush his moves with C8=7 now, black would have the huge advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Correct move to make.||R2=3 would be greedy and would allow red to increase his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is a simple but direct approach to the game.||Red intends to simplify things.||Playing E3+5 is another alternative and red would still probably hold a small lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Refusing the exchange is the correct choice to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]This is the more straightforward approach to the game.||If black chose to move R3=4, red would have the significant advantage.||Jim: For beginners, red CANNOT move E5+7 to capture the black chariot as black would simply answer with a smothered cannon checkmate (C7+3).[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]And red would still cling on to a small lead in the game.||In Summary:||This variation is relatively less complex and more steadfast. The beginner should be able to master this opening easily. The subvariations are also less violent and complex and thus easier to learn.||It would be hard for either side to have substantial gains in this variation and the margin for error is relatively bigger.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]And black's 3rd file would be under much stress. Red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]And red would be prepared to play C7=5 for the next move.||The implications of this are:||a) black would not be able to capture the central pawn with C5+4 now, as the double cannons are guarding the central pawn,||b) black has NOT advanced either the 3rd or 7th filed pawn, and that would greatly impede the development of his horses.||Red on the other hand would have ample space to develop his horses. Red would thus have the significant upperhand.||Jim: for beginners, in chariot-less midgames/endgames, the speed of the horses are often crucial and can determine the outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]And red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And red would be better.||Jim: For beginners, black has made too many moves with the black chariot, thereby decreasing the efficiency of black's moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]And black would have taken control over the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And it would be a relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
