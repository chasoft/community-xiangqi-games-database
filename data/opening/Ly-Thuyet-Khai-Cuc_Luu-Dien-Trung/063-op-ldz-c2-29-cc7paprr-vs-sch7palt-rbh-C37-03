[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 29 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C37 03||第29局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红左横车型||||ECCO：C37 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C37 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]As seen from the diagram, red utilizes the left ranked chariot. This is another very important variation, and option for red against black's riverbank orse. It grew in popularity in the 1970's.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]A steadfast approach to the game. P7+1 would give the game to red![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Red chooses to control this rib file with the chariot. This is a powerful move if compared to R9=4.||If red tried R9=4 instead, black could counter with C8=6 and black would have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black counters with this cannon move. The black river bank cannon is played to give more power to the black riverbank cannon. It provides more power to black as black prepares to retaliate.||Playing P7+1 would be to red's advantage as red could counter with R2-1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red has two other options: ||H3-1 and C8+2.||Jim: Pls click on the variations below to understand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And red attacks by blocking the elephants. This is  to prepare for C5+5 to attack the central elephant. A very aggressive counter.||H3+5 would most probably result in a slight advantage to red as black would counter with P5+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And black responds nicely. This is better than C2-2 which is much more passive and simple. ||With H3-5, there are more options for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And blood would be shed everywhere. Both sides would be going at it.||In summary,||in the lt riverbank horse variation, R9+1 was once  very popular. However, the rise in popularity of the edge cannon for chariot defense variation (which has been introduced extensively at the beginning of this chapter) gradually saw a decline in this sub-variation of the left riverbank horse.||Maybe one day, as people learn more about this opening, it might become popular again.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]viable but not so desirable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]And red is slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]Jim: hmm, this was the move given in the board.||I wonder if P3+1 was feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]　　双方均势。[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]Jim: Just wondering...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]Too complicated for me... lol[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]!||Jim: To give the chariot a root![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]And thsi would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]Not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]And red would have better development of the chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]Not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_30]And black would regain lost material, together with control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_14]Not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]And red is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]
