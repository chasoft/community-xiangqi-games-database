[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c3 72 sdc fr vs rr 01||第72局顺手炮直车对横车（1）   ||  ||ECCO：D24 順炮直車對橫車||ECCO D24 Same direction Cannons: Filed chariot vs Ranked chariot ||||Jim: We start off with another new big section.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]In the filed chariot vs ranked chariot variation, making this move was one of the oldest way for red to attack. Unfortunately, modern day study has deemed this to be a bad move, as red would be susceptible to a vicious counter attack by black.||Modern day opening theory suggests that black play H8+7 or P3+1 now instead of this move.||Jim: The modern day opening variations will be discussed in the boards to come!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]As can be seen, black pushes the 3rd file pawn forward, preparing to counter immediately. This is a very proactive and aggressive counter from black.||R9=4 is another option but it would to be red's advantage.　||Jim: Please view the ancient manuals, especially the Secret in the Tangerine and the Plum Flower Manuals on this site for more on this variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And this is a very famous black counter. It is called 天馬行空 in chinese. Loosely translated, 天馬行空 would be approximately equivalent to the heavenly horse galloping the skies variation. ||Jim: This is a VERY VERY important variation that made history when it first appeared in one of the earlier National Chinese Singles Championships way back in the 1950's. In one of the games played, the late GM Yang Guanlin took red and lost badly to this variation. GM Yang was the UNDISPUTED king of the central cannon opening at that time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]This is a simple, straightforward, no-nonssense move from black. Very effective too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black has wrestled the lead away from red in this game.||In summary, ||The "Heavenly Horse Galloping the Skies" variation was once very popular in the 1950's. As red had trouble holding on to his lead in this variation, red's R2+6 move on the third move gradually moved into extinction after being replaced by H8+7 or H8+9 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red could threaten to win material with C7-1 on the next move.||Red would better in this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]And all of black's pieces are poised for attack. Black would still have a say in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]Jim: Another variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]and it would be a relatively even game.||Black would be satisfied with this outcome![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]Jim: for beginners, this is to prevent black from playing C5+4. Please view to the variation that I have added.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And red would still have the significant advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_11]Jim: Say red plays this move instead...and falls for red's trap instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_14]And black would be not far away from victory as red has lost a chariot so early in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]Jim: And black does not lose material...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]And black does not lost material either![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_10]Jim: This variation was found in the GM's book, and is also one of the many variations found in the ancient manuals, but it would be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_15]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]And red would have the advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]
