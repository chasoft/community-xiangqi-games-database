[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 17 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C48||第17局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五六炮型  ||||ECCO：C48 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C48 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Red plays the 56 Cannons variation||||Jim: Please refer to the previous board before you start this one.||In this board, GM introduces a less volatile variation, the 56 Cannons by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Red traverses the cannon to form the 56 Cannons.||This is a relatively new variation, which stresses on balanced albeit slow development of the chess pieces. It has become quite fashionable to play this variation in the recent years.||The characteristics of such an opening is that red would have a tough defence with good linkages of the chess pieces. ||The downside is that black gets to play his right chariot first.||As seen in the diagram at this stage, it would be common sense for Black to play R1=2. ||Jim:For beginners, red's cannons (one on the central file and the other at the palace corner) are arranged in the 56 Cannons formation. It is because one cannon is on the 5th file, and the other is on the 6th file. By default or habit, even if the cannons were arranged such that one was on the 5th file and the other was on the 4th file, it would still be called the 56 Cannons, and not the 54 Cannons. And 56 is not an integer, it does not mean that red would have fifty-six cannons on the board...||The 57 Cannons, 58 Cannons and 59 Cannons are named in the same manner.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]R8+5 is another option.||Jim: Please click on the variation below to see it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Jim: As black has played R1=2 first, Red can only choose to develop his chariot with the ranked chariot, and in this case, R9+2. ||I would have to look through my books to see if there are R9+1 variations.||The main reason for R9+2 is to counter black's R1=2 with an exchange.||And if you noticed, red's formation is very firm and stable, although the pace of the game is now slow, as compared to the previous boards in this chapter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And red chooses to offer a chariot exchange. It is quite a new idea and has been appearing with increased frequency in the recent years. ||It is a favourite of many players with a more steadfast style of play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]If black played C7-1, red would be better!||Jim: Please click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Traversing the cannon to the sidelines is one of the latest moves with this variation.||Red would get the upperhand if black tried C7-1.||Jim: Please click on the variation below to understand why. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]If red were to choose to play P5+1 instead, black could try to force a draw with R8=6. If that were to happen, it would NOT be to red's advantage to play P5+1 then.||That is why H7+6 would be a better option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]This would be better than playing R8+5.||Jim: Click on the variation to understand why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And red would have the advantage.||In summary, ||this variation would lead to a more stable game for both sides. The main battle would take place in the middle game and the endgame. That is why it is a favourite of players well versed in the endgame.　||Jim: Often, in actual competition, a player would choose to play a more stable variation so that the game can be decided in midgame, instead of a tight game with much less room for error. That way, one could also prevent oneself from falling into various possible traps.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]Jim: Red could play H3+4 if black tried R8=7. I am too tired to search for a reason why black played this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]And red would be better.||Jim: Red would be faster in attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]And red would be better!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
