[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 08 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C42||第08局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型肋车捉炮（1）  ||Red plays the 59 Cannons and retreats his horse early.||||ECCO：C42 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C42 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]As seen in the diagram, red advances his chariot to try to capture the cannon.||This variation appeared in the 60's in the last century and soon became one of the major variations. ||After a few decades, it is still often seen in actual competition, which is proof of its complexities and many subvariations that have stood the test of time.||When faced with this variation, black has two choices:||C7+5 and C2-1. ||C7+5 will be discussed in this example, while C2-1 will be discussed in the next example.||C7+1 is not advisable...[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Black gives up his pawn to prevent red from playing H3+4 later.||This is one frequently used attacking tactic.||Another commonly played black variation would be C7=3, which will be discussed in the next variation. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]If red chose C4-5 instead...black would be able to  achieve a desirable opening!||Click on the variation to understand why!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]This is a good tactic by black, trying to oppress the development of red's left flank.||Red would be awarded with significant control of the game if black tried C2=9 now!||Click on the variation to understand why! 　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]C9-1 is not advisable for red now!||Click on the variation to understand why!!!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Nice counter from red!!!||Black prepares to sacrifice material before gaining it back, while dissolving red's attack in the process!  　[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Red must play this move!||Red blocks the black chariot under the pretext of trying the capture it. If this were played, black could suddenly have a seething offence with C2+3. Red would be in much trouble then![/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]C5=3 would lead to a sticky situation...||Click on the variation to understand why!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]And the endgame basically simplifies to that of 2r vs 1r2h. Under most circumstances, this would probably lead to a draw.||Summary:||When red attempts to capture the cannon with R4+2 in move 11, the variations that follow are relatively simpler and easier to grasp. If black is able to handle red's aggressions from the center, black can ensure at least a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]And the pace of the game has suddenly died down.||It becomes more of a grappling match than a fist fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]Not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And black has formed a blockade! Black would have much trouble trying move his pieces, let alone trying to develop them.||Black is better!!!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]If red chose to fork the cannons...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]And looking from the state of things, black is able to handle red's aggressions comfortably.||Jim: The effects of P7+1 by black on move 13 are seen now![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]Why this is not feasible...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]And red would be threatening the central pawn.||Red would be better!||Jim: ||a) Black's defensive formation would be that of the single horse defense in this variation. The central file is always a cause of concern and red gets to attack the center as he had planned from move 1 with the central cannon. ||b) For beginners, at this stage in the game, red would have made 10 moves in effect (4 chariot + 3 horse + 2 cannon + 1 pawn ) while black has made only 8 effective moves( 2 chariot + 3 horse + 1 cannon + 1 pawn + 1 advisor). Even if black another effective move on round 12, black would have made just a total of 9 moves. Red has gained a one move advantage thus far. For more, see the basics section.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]
