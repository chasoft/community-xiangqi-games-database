[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 52 cc5paprr vs sch7pa||第52局中炮急进过河车对屏风马7卒红进中兵 ||||ECCO：C17 中炮過河車對屏風馬||ECCO：C17 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked Chariot vs Screen Horse Defense.||||Jim: This is the start of another big and major variation in the cc vs sch opening system. The GM introduces this opening in 5 boards.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]It would not be advisable to play P5+1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]C8+4 and R2=3 are other viable alternatives.||Jim: Pls click on the variations to see them.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]As can be seen, this is the basic formation for today's discussion: red's central cannon with rapid pawn ranked chariot vs black's screen horse defense with the double headed snake pawn formation ( 3rd and 7th pawn advancement).[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Black's C8+2 is a better counter as compared to C2+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]This cross river cannon move is a very important intermediate move (zwischenzug) for black to make.||This would force red to play C6+3, after which black would have H7+6 as a power counter to attack the two red riverbank chariots.||This would effectively leave red with a flaw that he must deal with. ||If black played P7+1 as expected, red would simply move R2=3 and the variations that follow would be to red' favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Red cannot play P5+1 now or black would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]And it would be a rather even game.||In summary:||for this variation, red would have a hard time trying to increase his lead and black would be able on more than one occasional to hold his own against red. That is why this variation is less used by red nowadays.||Another possible reason is that the opening is rather straightforward and red's attack could be more or less anticipated by black. The lack of other options for attack is a major concern.||For this opening to have further development, this issue must be addressed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]And black's pieces would be well developed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]And red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]And it would be an attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And it would be an attacking game but black would seem to have the better time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]And black would have the huge advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]And it would be an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]
