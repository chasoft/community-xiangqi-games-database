[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 38 ccrrr7fh vs sch 01||第38局中炮横七路马对屏风马左炮巡过河 ||Black's left riverbank cannon variation.||ECCO：C13 中炮右橫車對屏風馬||ECCO C13 Central cannon with right ranked chariot vs Screen Horse Defense.||Jim: This is the start of another big variation in the cc vs sch battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And we arrive at the basic formation of this opening.||Red's formation is the Central Cannon with Ranked Chariot and 7th File Horse Variation while Black's counter is basically the Screen Horse Defnse.||This opening started becoming very popular in the 1960's and after decades of improvement and evolution, it has become a big topic of discussion by itself.||The main characteristics of this opening is that for both sides, one can choose to attack or defend and there are many complex variations for each choice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]As seen in this example, black plays the riverbank cannon preparing to push P3+1 on the next move to develop his right horse. This is one of the more stoic choices for black.||Black can also choose to play A4+5/C8=9/C2+4. All these variations will be discussed in the boards to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]H7+6 is another often played alternative. ||Please click on the variation to see it![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]C9+4 would lead a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Playing C8=7 now would result in an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red would hold on to a slight advantage in this outcome.||In summary, black's left riverbank cannon is more than sufficient to handle red's right ranked chariot and 7th filed horse.||P3+1 is the key to black's success. In fact, if black's right horse were developed, all of black's pieces would be able to very powerful and would be  a big threat to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_36]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And it would be a rather even game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]And black would be able to hold his own in this game. Red would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]And despite red's aggressions, he can do nothing against black's solid defense![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
