[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 23 cc7paprr vs sch7pa rt a e C31 01||第23局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马右士象（1） ||||ECCO：C31 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬上士||ECCO C31 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and Right Advisor Variation ||Red goes for C8=7.||||Jim: Congratulations for making thus far. After weeks of the edge cannon for chariot exchange, we go into a new topic. ||This is another major variation for black, especially for those who are bored with the ecrx variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]As seen from the diagram, this is another commonly played variation in the cc vs sch saga. ||This variation is also quite an aggressive counter from black, and is quite a favourite of players who want to avoid the ecrx variations and traps.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And red's C8=7 is a targeted approach to this variation.||H8+7 is also another option which would be discussed in the following board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]H7+6 by black now would result in a red advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]R2=3 is also another commonly played variation. ||Please click on the variation below. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]GOOD MOVE!||With this move, red is now able to prevent black from harrasing his cannon with H6+4 and also provide a root for this chariot.||This is a necessary move to prepare for what comes next!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red would have the advantage.||In summary,||C8=7 by red is a powerful counter to black's A4+5. As long as red is able to snuff out black's potential H6+4 counter, red would be able to obtain a favorable outcome in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]Black could also counter with C8+6 or C2+4, both of which are much more volatile variations. They are not discussed in because of the limited scope of this book.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]And it would be a generally even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]Not advisable for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]Red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
