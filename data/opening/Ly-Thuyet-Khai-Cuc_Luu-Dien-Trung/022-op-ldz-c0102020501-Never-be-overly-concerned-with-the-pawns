[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020501 Never be overly concerned with the pawns||In the opening stages, being over protective of the pawns may result in poor development of the chess pieces, and thus put you in a passive position.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Jim: For those who do not know, black's counter is  known as the blind eyed dog counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And we arrive at this formation.||Red is in a dilemma. Black's elephant now threatens to capture the red cross river pawn with E5+3.||Should red protect the pawn?||Or should the pawn be sacrificed?[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]The decision that red makes now would have a profound effect on the game.||Two variations are discussed:||P7+1 and E7+5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Jim:Black threatens to capture the pawn, which red holds dear since he has already spent 3 moves on it...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And black would get to move his chariot out in the open very quickly.||Black has started to prepare to launch a counter offensive while all of red's major attacking pieces have not budged. ||In the opening stages, the pawns must be dealt with much care. Disciplined analyses is required to determine whether to protect or to sacrfice the pawns. Decisions would be made based on comparing the resultant formations of saving/protecting the pawns vs sacrificing the pawns. Of course, the basic tenets of opening theory must not be violated either.||NEVER protect the pawns with a resultant loss in tempo![/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]If red was not overly protective of the pawn..[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]And red would still be in control of the game.||Please compare this variation with the one in the major variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]
