[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 09 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C45||第09局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型肋车捉炮（2）  ||Red plays the 59 Cannons and retreats his horse early.||||ECCO：C45 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C45 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse ||||Jim: This is a continuation of the previous board. Please review the previous board before going through this one![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]As seen in the diagram, black pressurizes the red horse with his cannon.||Red counters by pushing his horse H3+4 forward for the riverbank horse variation, preparing to attack the central pawn. Red could also consider playing P5+1 followed by H4+6. ||It is not advisable to play P5+1 now, as the variation below will show.　　||Jim: Playing this move would allow more options for red, rather than telling black that the attack would be from the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]In the past C2-5 was played most of the time, but long term follow up of the outcome showed that red would still be able to hold the lead. ||This move is an improvision.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Black chooses to sacrifice the horse in favor of a vicious retaliation. C3=5 would lead to a situation favorable to red.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]H5+3 would lead to an aggressive attack from both sides. ||Click on the variation to understand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]C5=3 would give the advantage to black![/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]H8+7 would lead to a very complicated game! ||Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]And the pace of the game has slowed down and is about even.||In summary, this variation is a very volatile one. One of the black's tactics is to use the sacrifice to try to attack to try to obtain an even situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]And black sacrifces yet ANOTHER piece to try to wrestle the control of the game away from red.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_44]Both sides would be about equal, but the moves that follow are very very complicated.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]Black is obviously better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_40]And both sides would be attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_35]It would be a fist fight now. Red is better though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_28]"Move that was used to be made."[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]Advise move. P7+1 would still allow red to attack first. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]And red could choose to attack first. ||Red would still be faster.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_40]Black is slightly better!　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]And black would gain back lost material with R4+3 on the next move. Black would be better! 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_34]
