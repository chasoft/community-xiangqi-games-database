[DhtmlXQ_comment4]As seen from the diagram, red plays the 3 pawn before red has a chance to choose which pawn to advance.||This is the basic starting formation of an age old opening, and could be seen in the Qing Dynasty's Plum Flower Manual.||As black has advanced the pawn too early, his intentions are clear and red would have an easy time countering.||Red would also develop his pieces faster than black and would let black lag further behind in the opening.||That is why it is seldom played nowadays.||But it still has its followers and can be still seen now and then in major competitions.。[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]R2+4 is another possible option.||Please click on the variation below to see it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]R2+4 is another possible option now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]R1=4 and R1=2 are sometimes played, but red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red would still hold on to a signficant lead in the game.||Summary:||In this variation, red has managed a better way of atttack, using the ranked and filed chariots nicely to organize his attack.||Black's has answered steadfastly too, but the loss of the black central pawn would be a worry as the game enters endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]And black would still be able to counter red's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]And black would lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]And red would have increased his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]And after sacrificing material, black would have managed to organize an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]And red would be still slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]And the game could easily become a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]And this variation would be the famous sacrifice horse to trap chariot variation. It was first seen in the Qing Dynasty's Plum Flower Springs Manual.  Contemporary study has shown that black would have the easier time.||For more on this variation, it is recommended that one browses through Yang GuanLin's <<弈林新編>>.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
