[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 04 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C45||第04局 中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型中炮打卒||Red plays the 59 Cannons with central pawn advancement variation||||ECCO：C45 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C45 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: A very volatile opening. Note that the ECCO for this is C45.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Playing the side cannon means that red would want to develop his left chariot in filed manner.||This left chariot would try to form a pincer attack together with the right chariot and is one of the most important variations in actual play today.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]And black starts his counter immediately.||This move has been proven over time to be a good counter, allowing black to prepare to charge his 7th pawn across a river to add pressure to a relatively empty right red flank. ||E7+5 may seem a steadfast option, but once red's left chariot gets to attack black's pawn rank black would be in a cramped position...||Jim: I have added the an extra variation for the beginner to have a better feel of the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red starts his attack by issuing an exchange with the central pawn.||Red uses his mighty central cannon in exchange for black's relatively immobile horse on the 3rd rank. This might seem that red has wasted a move here by exchanging a potentially more valuable chess piece  for a chess piece that has yet to prove its worth. However, red would get an extra central pawn, and force the black chariot on black's second file to be unprotected or rootless. This can offset the loss of the central cannon.||This variation was once very popular back in the 70's in the last century and was a favorite of aggressive players.||Other red options for this move would be C9+4, R4+2 and R8+6 which are beyond the scope of this board. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black chooses to stability over volatility with this move.||For aggressive players, P7+1 is an option which is listed in the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And red decides NOT to go head on with black's attack with this move.||This is a relatively new variation with good results.||In the past, E3+5 or E7+5 was played...||E3+5 is shown in the variation. E7+5 is not shown...[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And the game would still be rather complex with both sides attacking.||The first player to make a careless mistake could easily lose. ||In summary:||C5+4 to attack the central pawn would result in a situation that red would have trouble controlling. This was quite fashionable many decades ago but has gradually declined in the frequency played the past few years.||The reason is simple, red has a hard time trying to control the game, in comparison to other variations.||However, for the beginner, one must still learn this variation to have a better understanding of the game. This variation should be used judiciously in actual play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]And black would still have a very strong attack going on. The moves that follow have very complex variations and both sides are trading fist for fist.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]Aggressive!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]And both sides would be in attack mode, but red would have the material advantage and and better movement of the chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]Jim: I added the moves for this variation to let the beginner have an idea of what might happen if black did not play H7+8...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]Jim: Black could play other moves but this would not be relavant to this board...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]Jim: And red's chariots have oppressed the the available space that black can maneuver his chess pieces with. Although black gets to protect his center, the cramped position of the black pieces would forcee black to play the game more passively.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
