[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 44 57c7pa vs sch rt prc 02||第44局五七炮七兵对屏风马右炮压马 ||||ECCO：C68 五七炮互進七兵對屏風馬||ECCO：C68 57 Cannons with 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse defense with 7th Pawn Advancement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This is one of the older variations. The line of thinking behind this move is that black uses his cannon to oppress the development of the left red horse and chariot. ||In this way, the pressure of red's attack on the center can be deleted or dimished.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]This is usually played.||R9+2 is not advisable as red would be at a huge disadvantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]P3+1 would not be to red's advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]GOOD MOVE!||This move by black would help black gain tempo in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]R2+5 would be devastating for red!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Black would be better if red tried H2-3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And it would become a complex game for both.||In suammary, ||from the moves given above, it would seem that C2+6 (move #5) is a viable option for black to counter red's attack. Although the moves may lead to even more complex subvariations, black would seem to be able to do well as the entire left red flank would have much trouble trying to move, much less develop.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]And black would be much better!||Jim: The importance of room for development is seen here.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]Not advisable[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]And after the sacrifice, black has a huge lead in the game!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]Jim: Black now threatens to play C3+7 to capture the red chariot, which has not budged even up till this stage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]And black had gained control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_16]WRONG![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And all of a sudden, red has an attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_20]And red would be in trouble.||Jim: there was a misprint in the book, the move was given as C9=5. This should be the correct move as C2=5 is also impossible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]This is another alternative but Red would normally have more to lose than gain in this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]And at this stage in the game, red would have lost control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]
