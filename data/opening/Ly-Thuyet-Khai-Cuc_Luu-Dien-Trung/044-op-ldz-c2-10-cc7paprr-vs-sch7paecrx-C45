[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 10 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C45||第10局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型肋车捉炮（3）   ||Red plays the 59 Cannons and plays R4+2 to try to capture the cannon.||||ECCO：C45 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C45 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse ||||Jim: This is the third board on the opening in this series. Please go through the previous ones to have a better idea.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]C2+5 would result in red being in control!||Click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]This is the correct order of moves.||If Black played C7+1 first, red would be much better off!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]This was the earliest variation that red had come up with. As this opening evolved, C9+4, C5=6 and A4+5 ... were later studied and used.||The rest of the variations will be discussed in later boards.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]With this move, black frees himself from the pin by the red chariot. ||If black accepts the exchange, red would play R8+1, which would free the right horse to guard against red's C9+4.||That way, red's plans of lauching an attack from this flank are thwarted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]This is a more proactive variation from red.||Black prepares to fight fire with fire.||Jim: Other variations are not discussed here.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]And red counters black's aggression with even more aggression.||A4+5 would lead to both sides attacking. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]This is a must black move.||Red would have to ans with A4+5, before black plays R4=3.||This would make a world of a difference should black opt to play R8=3 directly,||Click on the variation to understand why!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]C3+3 would lead to a balanced game for both sides.||Click on the variation to understand why.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]According to the Chinese rules, if both sides do not change their moves, it would be a draw.||Summary:||Black's R8=4 in move 18 is a very good move, choosing the more proactive approach instead of purely defending. That move effectively eliminates the attack by red.||As for red, H7+5 on move 20 is a very vicious move. One should be wary of such sudden attack in the course of play.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]And it would be a balanced game for both sides.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_36]Why this is not advised.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_55]And red would have the material upperhand while threatening to kill in many different ways.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]And it would be a bloody battle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]Red is better.||Red would now have the important rib files in control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_24]Why this is not advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]And sacrifices material for control of the game!||Red is much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]
