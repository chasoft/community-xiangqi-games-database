[DhtmlXQ_comment15]If red chose to play R8+6 instead, it would be an even situation.。[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And this is the formation often reached in competition.||Other than R8+4, red could also choose to play:||1) P5+1 --> and black would sacrifice material to attack||2) P9+1 --> and red would lose his advantage in the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Playing P3+1 now would lead to an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And it would approximately equal for both sides. Red would be slightly better.||In Summary:||Such an opening would often lead to a standoff. The structure of your attacking or defensive formation would determine the game as it progresses. ||Black would have a certain amount of recoil.||If red does not use his two chariots to patrol the riverbank, it could easily become a very aggressive attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]And both sides would be approximately equal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]And black would sacrifice his horse for an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
