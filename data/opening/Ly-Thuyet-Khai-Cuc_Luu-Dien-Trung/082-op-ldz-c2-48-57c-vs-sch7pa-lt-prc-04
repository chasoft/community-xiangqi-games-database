[DhtmlXQ_comment12]In the past, this move was only seen occasionally as it would weaken black's right flank. The advantage would be that black would start forming a blockade on red's pieces.||However, as it is a very aggressive move, it has caught the eye of many players in the past two years (Jim: beginning of this century when this book was published), and has been developed to an extent that is is now a very aggressive counter against the 57 cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]A natural and must-make move to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red retreats the chariot to reorganize his attack. ||There are other options but red would not seem to gain much.||These are listed in the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]H3+2 is another possible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Stoic move to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black counters aggressively, threatening to capture the side horse. ||It is also a good move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Black is still slightly behind in the game thus far. ||With this exchange, black would further deplete the number of troops on the board so that the game would become drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And it would be a rather even game for both.||In summary,||Black's C8+4 blockade is a move that is worth much  study, as after the blockade, black has aggressive or defensive options to choose from. ||Black would be able to make use of this blockade to greatly decrease the threat that the 57 cannons  can pose, while dampening the attack the mobility of red's pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]And red would be slightly better as it would prepare to gain an elephant with H3+5 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]And it would be an attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]Black cannot play this move now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]And black would lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]And black would lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]And it would be an even game.||Jim: Black's defense is very tightly knit now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]And red's chariot would be lost.||Black would have the huge lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]And black would be able to handle red's aggressions to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]And red would have lost his lead in the game.||Jim: Please count the number of moves that red has made and you will see why after comparing the number of moves that black has made.||More on this can be found in the beginner's section.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]And black would have good prospects in the game to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_22]And black would have formed a blocakde on all of the major red pieces.||Red would have trouble developing his other chess pieces and his lead by default would have disappeared.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_22]
