[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 18 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C48||第18局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五六炮型||||ECCO：C48 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C48 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Red plays the 56 Cannons variation Part 2||||Jim:This is the second board discussing C8=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]As seen from the diagram, red plays the riverbank horse early, and prepares to develop his left chariot thereafter. This was also once a very fashioable opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This is the correct elephant to move to the center. If black tried to rush his moves and played R8+5, it would be red's advantage. ||Jim: Please click on the variation belwo to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]And black fights for the control of this rib file by issuing a chariot exchange offer![/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Advised move to make. ||If red tried to keep things complicated with R4=2, black would be better!||Jim: Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And it is advised for red to exchange his horse for black's side cannon to simplify things now.||Black would be better if red tried C6=7.||Jim: Click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]It would be basically an even game for both sides!||In Summary, ||in this game, black's correct movement of the elephant and the advisor to the center is of the utmost importance. That would allow black to fight for control of the rib file later and thus try to gain control of the game. 　||Jim: I am often asked which elephant/advisor to move in the early stages of the opening. Heck, I am often clueless, but this is a very good example. Please refer to the boards by Master Huang Shaolong's which were translated by Chris  Hankinson on the basics's openings in the opening page for more examples.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]And the game would become 'sticky"...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]NOT advised![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And black's chess pieces have more room to move!||Black is better!||Jim: In midgames/endgames whereby there are no chariots, the room for movement and speed of the chess pieces is of top priority![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]And ALL of black's pieces have much room to maneuver and has started a counter.||Black has successfully turned the tables![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_37]Red is better!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_37]
