[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Moving the advisor now was one of the earlier ways to counter the threat of red's ranked chariot. It is still played occasionally nowadays.||The advantages of this black move is that is allows black a sturdy defensive formation and fortifies the center. However, it would delay the development of the other chess pieces, causing black to fall further behind in terms of speed of the development of the chess pieces.||Modern day opening theory recommends R8+4 or H2+3 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And red chooses for a rapid attack with this move. H8+7 is played instead now.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Playing the side horse is correct. If black played H2+3 instead, red would have a huge advantage!||Jim: Please note that black has already played A6+5, therefore, black does NOT have the option of H7-5 to defend should he choose to play H2+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]By threatening to capture the cannon, red has formed a blockade on the entire right black flank. ||||Playing P9+1 now is not good for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]R8+4 would be to red's advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red would have the advantage.||In summary,||in the rr vs fr variation of the sdc, under most circumstances, the main battle line would be the containment of the opponent's chariot. A crucial factor that could determine the game for both sides would be the ability of the black chariot to  be developed from black's first file.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]And red has the obvious lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]Black is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_11]Not recommended![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]Black is much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]And red has lost the lead in his game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]Red has the obvious advantage![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]
