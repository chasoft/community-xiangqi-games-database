[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 05 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C45||第05局 中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五九炮型边炮打卒||Red plays the 59 Cannons and attacks the side pawn||||ECCO：C45 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C45 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: This is a continuation of the previous board.||Please go through the previous example before going through this one to have a better grasp.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]In this board, the topic of discussion would revolve around this variation.||By attacking the side pawn, red achieves the following:||1) one extra pawn||2) an additional cannon to attack the central pawn||3) Indirectly preventing black from pushing P7+1 for an attack.||This variation started appearing way back in the 1960's and is considered to be one of the major, orthodox variations of this opening.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]In this example, black's counter with P7+1, C7+5 and C2+4 are discussed. ||Please click on the various variations to below to view them.　||Jim: Please note that these are some of the more commonly played variations. It is beyond the scope of the book to introduce all, and beyond my capabilities too... ;)[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]This is a more recent variation. ||Red starts his attack with material gain.||In the past, R4=3 was played. Please click on the variation below to understand more.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]H3+5 is another variation sometimes played. ||Please click on the variation to understand.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]There are three ways for red to answer black's move: R3-2, R3=4 and R3=1. ||Please click on the variations to understand them.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]This is a commonly played skewer known as "丝线拴牛" or leading the ox with a string. (Jim: Another name for it is 猴拉馬 or monkey leading the horse...). This skewer tactic is often used in the opening to try to gain material and severely cripple the opponent's pieces.||Red cannot play C5-2 to answer this move.||Please click on the variation on the next move that I added to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]This is the correct order of moves for black.||Playing C2=4 first would be diastrous for black!||Click on the variation below to understand why.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Black cannot be in a hurry and play R8=4 to try to gain material!||　[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]And it would be a relatively evengame.||Red would have more pawns but black has red in a skewer.||Black cannot be greedy and play R8=4 now as red could play R3+3 for an exchange anytime. That would really be the demise of black.||Taking all things into consideration, this would be a relatively even game for both sides.||Summary: ||Red's C9+4 to take the side pawn is a variation worth discussing. This red variation places pressure on black to make the best appropriate moves with little room for error as red would enter the midgame with a significant pawn advantage.||Black can only counter precisely and accurately to try to keep the game even.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]Too fast![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]And red would have the obvious advantage as the pawns would be a nightmare for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]Uh-oh...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_39]And red sacrifices material first before gaining it back, together with control of the game.||The red pawns look priceless now...　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]Jim: Red cannot play this move to try save himself from the skewer.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]Because black would counter with this move instead and force the red chariot to a very very precarious position. ||Red is bound to lose material now![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]Black could play R8=6 on the next move!!!||Not too ideal for red as red would be in trouble by then.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]Black has successfully limited the red chariot to the side file and would is now starting to mount a counter.||Black is ok in this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]And red is better.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_31]And red's pawn advantage gives him the upperhand in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]"Older" variation...[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]And red has the obvious advantage in the number of pawns and is slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]And red would have the upperhand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_29]And red would have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_29]
