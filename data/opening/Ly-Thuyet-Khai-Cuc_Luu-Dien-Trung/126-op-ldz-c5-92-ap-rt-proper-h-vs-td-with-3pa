[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c5 92 ap rt proper h vs td with 3pa||第92局进兵对卒底炮红右正马黑冲3卒 ||||ECCO：E10 仙人指路對卒底炮||ECCO：E10 Angel's Pawn vs Thundering Defense[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black's precise, targeted counter with C2=3 is sometimes called the small central cannon.||Red's opening and black's counter has received much improvement in the past 20 odd years and has become an opening system of its own.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]When red makes this move, it shows that he is prepared to sacrifice the pawn he just played for gains in increase in tempo.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Black would also play P3+1 as it would be a natural move to make.||If black countered with H2+1, black's C2=3 would become very inefficient and defeat its original purpose.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]This is a good move by black.||Playing C3-1 would allow red to increase his lead in the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Red should not play R9=8 now or black would be able to wrestle the control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Advancint the horse to protect the pawn allows black to maintain his cross river pawn.||H8+6 now would allow red a slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is a brilliant move by red, allowing red to play C4+4 on the next move to attaack while also allowing red to play E7+5 to defend.||It is a very versatile move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And black counters red's C8=4 with this move.||Another commonly played variation would be R1=2 whereby it would be a rather even game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Playing this move is an improvision of P7+1 which was played in the past. Playing P7+1 now eould allow red an increase in his initiative.||By playing double ranked chariot now, black is prepared to use one chariot to exchange for two cannons.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Black would still have a game going on if red chose to play C+=5 now. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And black would have snatched the lead away from red.||Summary:||This is quite a new opening and it is still undergoing evolution..||Before further breakthroughs are made, black's cross river pawn has placed much pressure on black. ||The ability of red to place his 4th file cannon (after C8=4 on the 7th move) to good use is another important issue to resolve. This would be instrumental in the game to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]And black would still have a nice game going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]move made in the past[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]And red would be much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_16]R2+8 is another possible option.　||Jim: However, there were not moves given in the manual...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]Jim: Red's chariot CANNOT take the black cannon now! I have added a variation to explain why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]And red would still be able to maintain a slight lead over black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]And suddenly, the red chariot is trapped. ||Losing a chariot so early in the game would not be good for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]And red's advantage by default would be lost.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_15]And red would be much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_7]And red's left horse is well developed. Black's first C2=3 move would thus become inefficent and defeat its purpose.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_7]
