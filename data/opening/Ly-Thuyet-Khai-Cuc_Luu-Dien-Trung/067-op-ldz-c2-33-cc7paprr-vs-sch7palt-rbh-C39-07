[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 33 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C39 07||第33局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红五九炮型黑冲卒逐车 ||ECCO：C39 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C39 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation||||Jim: In this variation, some of the comments are a little bit contradictory but I have tried to be as true to the original manual as possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]In recent competition, other than R2=4 and this move, R2-1 is being played incrreasingly.||Please click on the variation to see it...[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And Black goes on the aggressive by charging this pawn across the river!||This moves is currently accepted as the best move that can allow Black to be in the game.||It has been played many times in actual compeitition and the characteristic of this variation is that both sides would usually end up attacking one flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Correct move!||P7+1 would be red's advantage.||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Black would be better if red tried H6+5 now.||Please click on the variation to undestand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And this would be a good counter from black. This is to provide additional support for his right flank.||C2=1 would give the game to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]A tight knit move from red!||If red went ahead with H5+7 now, red would be in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And black cannot choose to play R8=4 now as it would be to red's favor.||Please click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And red would be slightly better.||In summary,||this variation is quite fashionable at the moment (at the time of print of course, around 2000) in the Beijing area and there is much room for further refinement.||As time goes by and as people understand more about this variation, I believe that there will be more and better variations.||In this variation, black's P7+1 move (move 8) allows it to keep the pressure on red. And black continues this play with R8+4 on move 13, allowing  support for his troops on the other flank. Black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]nope...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]And red gains back lost material. It is obvious that red's position is much better and black is cramped.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]And black would be prepared to play H3+4 to retaliate.||Red would be in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]And the positioning of the black chess pieces would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_20]The position of the black pieces are slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]And red would have the advantage now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]This variation appeared recently.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_17]Black's two chariots are being tied down. Red has the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]Jim: This move was given as H6-4 in my manual...but I think it is a print error.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]And black can be satisfied with this outcome.||Jim: I think there is an error in the moves transcribed. But to be true to the original work, I have translated the manual as precisely as possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
