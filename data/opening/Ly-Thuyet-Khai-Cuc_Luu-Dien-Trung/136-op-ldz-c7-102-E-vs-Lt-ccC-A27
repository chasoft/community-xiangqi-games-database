[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c7 102 E vs Lt CC A27||第102局飞相对左中炮||ECCO：A27 飛相對左中炮||ECCO: A27 Elephant opening vs Left Central Cannon Opening.||||Jim: The central cannon has been king for the past few centuries. Therefore, it was natural to use the central cannon as a counter against the elephant opening when the elephant started becoming popular over the past few decades.||Most of the time, it would be a reversal of roles for both sides as red would eventually develop into the screen horse or sandwiched horse defense or even the single horse defense. Black's central counter would be the same, except for the fact that Red would have the one move initiative now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Jim: Usually C8=5 is played instead of C2=5. The main reason for this is that black would be able to play C2=3 to pressure red's elephant on the baseline for the 57 cannon formation. If C2=5 were played, and black continued with C8=7, there would be no target to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Using the left central cannon to counter the elephant opening was once very popular. It is more commonly played than the right central cannon.||However, with the evolution of the Left Cross Palace Cannon and Right Palcorner Cannon, the left central cannon has slowly taken a back seat and is less seldomly used in competition nowadays. ||It is still a favourite counter for more aggressive players. ||As seen in this diagram, red plays C2=4 to become the sandwiched horse formation. The screen horse defense was the favored opening in the past and the various major variations are introduced below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]P3+1 is another feasible alternative.||Pls click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]The main purpose of this move is to try to limit the movment of the black pieces on the cannon rank.||C8=9 would lead to stable formations for both sides,||Please click on the variations to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This would be a more steadfast approach by black. R6+5 would probably allow red to be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And both sides are relatively equal.||In summary, when black chooses the left central cannon to counter the elephant opening, anything is possible. Red could use the screen horse formation, the sandwich horse formation...||In this example,as it is red who plays the screen horse defense, red is able to play one extra elephant move. This in an important difference to appreciate as Red would now start the game with a more defensive formation. Most of the time, the game would be a battle of formations and a test of patience. It would be easy to get into sticky situations for both sides and if black tries to attack too aggressively, black would be vulnerable to forceful and rapid counters from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]And as can be seen, both sides have very stable formations. The game would be decided in midgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]And this would still be a playable situation for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]Red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_29]
