[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c3 76 sdc fr vs sr 01||第76局顺手炮直车对缓开车（1） ||ECCO：D14 順炮直車對緩開車||ECCO D14. Same Direction Cannons: Filed Chariot vs Slow Chariot||||Jim: This is a relatively new variation in the sdc opening. GM Hu RongHua is credited to have made this opening popular.||A direct translation for black's counter would be the slow chariot.||However, Mr Chris Hankinson has suggested the deferred chariot as an alternative. I tend to agree with deferred chariot but since I have uploaded many games and opening boards on this variation using the slow chariot, I will continue to use it interchangeably.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Up till the 1960's, basically the moves played for black followed the ancient manuals, especially those in The Secret in the Tangerine, the Plum Flower Manuals etc.||That is why, when red plays R1=2, black would most often counter with the ranked chariot R9+1. ||In the 1960's, red started using the left proper horse (H8+7) and instead of moving the chariot, red played P3+1. This was a viable alternative.||Black took a page out of Red's new alternative and developed this variation instead.||It opened a whole new section in this traditional opening and is now an essential segment.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]P7+1 now would lead to an attacking game for both.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black playing R1+1 now would lead to an attacking game for both sides, with red holding the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]H7+6 is another viable alternative for red, with red being slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]R9=7 by red now would be to black's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Other often played alternatives are:||1) R4+3 --> red would hold on to the lead||2) C5-1 --> red would be better||3) P7+1 --> very complex variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Playing A4+5 would be red's slight advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Retreating the horse for an exchange of black's central cannon is advised.||E3+1 would allow black an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]E1+1 would result in an even game now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And red has the advantage.||In summary, after decades of study, many conclusions have been drawn about this opening. ||Basically red would be able to maintain his advantage by default and achieve desirable outcomes in this opening.||Black would have to make further improvisions should black want to achieve better outcomes where this variation is concerened.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]A rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And black would be prepared to attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]And red would be slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]Red is much better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]Red is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]And although black has made some material sacrifice, black is on the attacking end now,.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]And black can be satisfied with this outcome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]And red would be slighly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]Black would still be able to hold his own in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_10]　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_25]And it would be an attacking game for both sides with red holding to the lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]And it would be attacking game for both. ||There are areas of concern to address for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_26]
