[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c7 100 E Rt pH vs Lt CPC A34||第100局飞相对左过宫炮  ||ECCO：A34 飛相進右馬對左過宮炮||ECCO A34 Elephant Opening with Right Proper Horse vs Left Cross Palace Cannon  ||Jim: There are only three examples on the elephant opening in the book, all found under Chapter 7.||For International Chess players, the elephant opening might be a natural choice because of its defensive nature and more deliberate development of the chess pieces. The pace of the game would be similar too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]The elephant opening has been one of the fastest growing openings over the past few decades.||When playing the elephant opening, the emphasis is on balanced development of the chess pieces over a rapid attack. Progress is slow but sure and unlike certain openings whereby the attack is fast and furious, the pace of attack in the elephant opening is much slower. ||It can be said that the main battle would occur in the midgame and endgame. It is more of a test of one's midgame and endgame skills.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]The left cross palace cannon is one of the major counters against the elephant opening. It became prominentin the 1960's and is now one of the important counters.　||Jim: For beginners, it is widely accepted that E3+5 is the first move played for the elephant opening. Black's C8=4 would mean that black's left cannon is used as the cross palace cannon. That is why black's counter is known as the left cross palace cannon. There is nothing wrong with red playing E7+5 as the first move and it follows that if black were to choose this counter, it would be : 1. E7+5 C2=6. Although it would now be black's right cannon that is used as the cross palace,for practical purposes ( and simplcity's sake) this would still be called the left cross palace cannon. The same principle applies to the right palcorner cannon counter[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]An importan move to make!||Advancing the 7th pawn would allow black to develop his horse, while at the same time, delay or inhibit the development of red's horse in the same file.||Playing R9=8 now would give the game to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]As seen in the diagram, black raises the ranked chariot. The main motive of this move is to target red's P7+1 and to develop this chariot along that file.||R9=8 would develope into an even game for both sides. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]This is a nice move for red! Red is prepared to sacrifice material to gain it back later.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Jim: Red's R9=8 shows its influence on the game now. Red is now prepared to play R2=7 to capture the pawn.||Black on the other hand cannot play C3=2 as red's chariot would be waiting.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And black counter sacrifices the pawn.||Although the pawn is lost, with this move, black is able to gain a slight advantage in the number of effective moves played.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And red would be slightly better off.||In summary, the elephant vs cross palace cannon opening is basically an opening whereby it is more of a test of your Xiangqi kungfu, as compared to other variations whereby there are fixed tabiat to follow.||Such an opening would also place a greater requirement on emphasis on the finer details of development.||In this variation, a key point for black would be black's ability to develop his ranked chariot. This is the main issue in this variation and would affect the midgame and endgame to come.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]And it would be a relatively even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]Why this is not advisable...||Jim: Damn, I have made this move instinctively many times...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]Redis in control![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
