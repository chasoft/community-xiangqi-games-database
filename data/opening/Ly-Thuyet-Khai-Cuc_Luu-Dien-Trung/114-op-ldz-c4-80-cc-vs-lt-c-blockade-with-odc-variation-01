[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 80 cc vs lt c blockade with odc variation 01||第80局中炮对左炮封车转列炮（1） ||  ||ECCO：D32 中炮進三兵對左炮封車轉列炮||ECCO：D32 Central Cannon with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Left cannon blockade with ODC variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Black advances his cannon to try to form a blockade on red's right flank, before playing the opposite direction cannons variation. This is a modern day way of playing the odc.||It was once very popular and is still often seen in major competitions. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red charges his horse to the river bank for an immediate counter in this variation. The game would immediately become a standoff.||H8+7 and H8+9 are other often played variations which will be introduced in later boards.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This move appeared in the recent years, and is one of the better counters. ||Black could also choose one of the following...||1) C8-2 --> red would have the advantage||2) R1+1 --> red would gain material and have the easier time. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]P3+1 now would give black the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]An important move to make.||P3+1 would cause black to lose material and also give the edge to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Correct move to make. C8+4 would give the game to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]H3-1 is another commonly played move but red would still control the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Sacrificing the pawn now would allow red's horse to be firmly positioned on the riverbank. It is a key move to make for red to be in control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red would still maintain his lead if he chose to play H8+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And it would still be to red's advantage.||||In summary:||In this variation, both sides start attacking early and there is little room for error. ||The key for red is the early riverbank horse (move 5). If this horse were able to receive sufficient backup, red would have an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And red would still be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]And the game would become equal.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]And red would still be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_16]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]And black would have wrestled control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_19]And red would gain material and be on the winning end.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]And black would be better!![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]And red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]And red would be up material wise and have the easier time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
