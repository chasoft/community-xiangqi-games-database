[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Playing this move first is a very important variation that has gained immense popularity with players taking black. It has been seen in competition very often.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]P3+1 now would surrender the control of the game to black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Other than R1+1, red has a few more ways of attack. ||Please click on the variations to see them.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Both sides play double ranked chariots. This is a rather rare scene and very intersting.||If black tried H8+7 instead....||Please click on the variation to see what would happen. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]If red played R9=4, it would an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And it would be a rather even game.||In summary, ||in this variation, both sides play double ranked chariots. This would perhaps be the main issue as whichever side is able to develop his chariots would basically have control of the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]

[DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]And black can be sasitified with the current state of affairs.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_14]And black would play R1=7 on the next move and wrestle the lead away from red. ||Red would have a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_14]
