[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 83 cc vs lt 3st with halfway odc variation  ||第83局中炮对三步虎转列炮  ||||ECCO：D43 中炮對左三步虎轉列炮||ECCO：D43 Central Cannon vs Left 3 step tiger with  ODC variation||||Jim: there was only this board in the GM's book. Pls refer to he ECCO 4x page for more on this.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]In modern day competition, when playing this opening, red would often choose to advance the 3rd or 7th filed pawn according to his  predetermined strategy. ||And black chose to counter with the left 3 step tiger with the deferred ODC variation. This counter has greatly increased the scope of black's 3 step tiger counter and has gradually evolved into a huge opening system by itself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]As seen from the board now, which is considered to be quite standard play, it would be natural for red to move P3+1 on the next move. If not, black would play R8+5 for the cross river chariot and red's riverbank would be at the mercy of this chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Correct move to play.||Playing R8+4 now would allow red to increase his lead in the game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is the recommended move to make.||If red chose H3+4 --> black would sacrifice material to launch a fierce attack.||If red moved H7+6 --> black would sacrifice material to gain control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]C8+3 is also another important variation in this opening.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Black would be better if red played C8=6 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And it would be a relatively even game.||In summary:||Red's central cannon with 3rd or 7th pawn advancement vs black's left 3 step tiger with deferred odc variation is an opening with much potential. This opening is still relatively seldom played and has a huge potential for development. ||The character of this opening is still not very well understod. More study and actual play are needed for this opening to become more commonly used.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]And red's formation would lack versatility.||Red would have a hard time trying to adjust his formation. His right horse is also pinned ( Jim: or the elephant would be lost). ||Black is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]New move! In the pase, black would usually play A6+5 but red would end up with the upperhand.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]?||Questionable move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]And black would have seized control of the game from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]Move that was used to be played![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]And red would have increased his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]And after the sacrifice, black would now be attacking with full force.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]And black is prepared to sacrifice material to launch a counter offensive.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_17]And black's two horses are barely developed and severely limited in movement. It would take much effort for black to try to develop his pieces.||Red would have increased the lead in his game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_17]
