[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 32 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C39 06||第32局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红五九炮型黑右炮封车 ||ECCO：C39 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C39 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]As can be seen, red traverses the cannon for the side cannon attack. ||When this is done, it means that red has decided to slow his attack on the right side of the board, in favor of development of his left chariot. ||It has been proven to be quite an effective strategy and is still used in competition very frequently even nowadays.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black can choose from R1=2 to try to from a blocakde on red's unmoved chariot, or he could also choose C2-1 or C2+4.||The variations are discussed below. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black can also choose C2+4 or C2+1. Please click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]P5+1 is another option. ||Please click on the variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]C8+4 would give the game to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]This is an important and delicate move from red!||H6+5 by red now would return any lead that red has in the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red is slightly better!||The variation shown in this board is still very fashionable today. For red players who prefer less bloodthirsty variations and want more control, this option is quite appealing.||Red's left chariot still pins the black chariot (rootless) and cannon and would often have the pawn advantage as game progresses.||That is why it is still frequently played by red when faced with such a black variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_36]Drawish game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]Red has the significant pawn advantage and has much room to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]Both sides would be attacking but red would seem to have the easier time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]And red has the pawn advantage and is in control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]!!!!||Jim: This is one of the things that the side cannon can do![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_18]Jim: This variation was not found in the book. I added it to show why the red side cannon was poisoned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]Red is much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]And red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_23]
