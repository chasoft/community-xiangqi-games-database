[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0101060101a Development of the Chariot||||BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE OPENING||The opening must try to lay the foundations for a win. That is why, both players would try to wrestle for control of the game. We have summarised the following rules to follow in your XiangQi opening.||||1) Move and develop your major chess pieces asap.||In Xiangqi, each player has 7 different types of chess pieces with different capabilities. Amongst the 7 , the chariot, horse and cannon are considered to the be the stronger pieces or the major pieces. One basic but very important opening tenet is that try as best as possible to limit your chariot/horse/cannon and let them occupy the important points on the board.||||a) Ample room for chariot development||The chariot is without doubt the strongest and most important chess piece on the board with its quick movement and power.||In the opening stages, the chariot is able to threaten the opponent's horse and cannon, capture pawns, force pawn exchanges to develop your own horses, be the back up for weaker spots , protect the other pieces or even directly threaten the opponent's king.||In actual play, the speed of the development of the chariots and their positions occupied would decide the game, whether it is to your favor or not. Therefore, it is common sense to try to keep the chariot's path as wide as possible and to try to control as many important points on the board as possible.||||This was an actual game played. Although both players have identical material, the outcome has been basically decided in black's favor. The main reason is that the positioning of the red pieces are too bad while all of black's pieces are well developed and ready to go.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
