[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 19 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C47||第19局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红边马型 ||||ECCO：C47 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C47 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Red plays the side horse.||||Jim: Another interesting opening! And it happens to be the only one there is by the GM.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Playing the side horse is an old variation that has survived through time and is still fashionable nowadays. ||The advantages of this move are:||1) Red can immediately prevent black attacking red's 7th file (and the proper horse should red play H8+7), and ||2) allow red to play C8=7 for the 57 Cannons as a counter.　||3) allowing a less explosive game than the H8+7 proper horse variation.||The downside of this move include:||1) slower development of this side horse, and||2) slower deployment of the chess pieces in general.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]As seen from the opnieng, black can counter with the following moves:||1) R8+5||2) A4+5||3) R8+8||4) H3-5||All the variations would be discussed in general. Jim: Please click on the variations below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]By retreating the horse to the center, black injects into his game more options and allows more versatility in the deployment of his troops.||If black played A4+5 now, red could play C8=7 and take his time to organize an attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]E3+5 would be hazardous for black now![/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]This move is the result of many years of study and proven in competition by various experts. The conclusion drawn is that this  move would allow red to have the say as the game progresses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Black cannot be greedy and capture the elephant with C7+8 now. Red would gain material and be much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Although red is one elephant up, black should be able to force a draw most of the time in the moves that follow.||In summary, ||although the side horse variation is one of the many many variations in the cc vs sch opening system, it is nevertheless an important variation to know. To date, this variation is still being explored and studied in the various major competitions. 　||Jim: And now you know![/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]And red is up material wise. ||Red is better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]The most important central file now belongs to Red. ||Red's central cannon has now added value.||Red in total control.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]Not good...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]And red is better!||The main reason for black's plight is that his A4+5 denied his own formation versatility, and was thus unable to counter red's changing formation as speedily.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]Red has a menacing central pawn, while black's chess pieces are much more mobile than red. ||It is an even game for both.||There is still much study to do before determining whether this variation is better for red or for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]Red is obviously better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]
