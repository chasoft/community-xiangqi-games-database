[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102021201 attack only at the best possible time||Under most circumstances, you attack only when the time is ripe. If the preparations for attack are not fully made, often, one would run out of gas and even be faced with the possiblity of a counter attack.||On the other hand, there are not many chances for attack. If one misses the optimal chance for attack, it would often be a regret that is hard to swallow.||As can be seen in this example, red has started with the central cannon. Black has countered with the screen horse defense with the left riverbank horse variation.||It is advisable for black to play E3+5 at this stage in the game now, to defend first.||If black chose to attack with P7+1, it would be rash and red would counter with R2=4. Black would then be in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black could choose to play:||1. H6+8/H6+7 or P7+1 but red would have the clear advantage in all three variations.||Black has not fortified his center and rushed his attack. This is forced play and should not be encouraged.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
