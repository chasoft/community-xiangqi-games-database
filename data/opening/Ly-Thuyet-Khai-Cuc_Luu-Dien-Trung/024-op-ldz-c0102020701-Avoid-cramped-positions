[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020701 Avoid cramped positions||||In the opening stages, the chess pieces should have as much place to move as possible. They should also be flexible and versatile.||When the strategy chosen calls for a concentration of forces, they should be concentrated BUT NOT CRAMPED. ||One must try to avoid cramped positions and try to relieve or unclog them, so that a balanced formation can be achieved.||If there are many chess pieces concentrated in a tiny area, and they are not maneuvered or 'unclogged' in a reasonable amount of time, the entire formation would be affected, and the efficiency of each individual chess piece would be greatly diminished. It would be hard to develop such formations.||In this example, red would start the game with the central cannon while black would counter with the mandarin duck cannons.||Jim: Please go to the opening section for more on the mandarin ducks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Jim: Basic formation of the mandarin duck cannons.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Jim: For beginners, red threatens to kill the chariot with C8=1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]And we arrive at this formation.||There are basically two choices for black to consider:||1. C2=5 --> red has the advantage||2. C2=8 --> red has the advantage.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red would prepare to sacrifice the horse to launch an attack. Red the obvious advantage.||Jim: As can be seen, red would have the easier time of the two because he has a more open position/formation to play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]After using his chariot in exchange for black's horse and cannon, red still gets to pin skewer the black chariot and horse. ||It is obvious that red has the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]
