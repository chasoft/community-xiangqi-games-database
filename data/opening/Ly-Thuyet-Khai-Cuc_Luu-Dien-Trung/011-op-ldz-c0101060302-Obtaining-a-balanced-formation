[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0101060302 Obtaining a balanced formation||||This is another example that would help the beginner understand the importance of a balanced formation and relationships between the chess pieces.||Black's formation is well balanced and has good links. The black cannon is protecting the horse on the 7th file, and although the horse on the 3rd file is not protected, it has great mobility and can charge forward at any time. The links between the chess pieces can be appreciated.||Red on the other hand has a very poor formation. It has poor links and the relationships between the major chess pieces are weak or non-existent. The red horse is stuck and not developed. If it were on the 3rd file instead, red's situation would be slightly better.||If for example, black's red pawn was at its original position, while red's pawn on red's 7th file is advanced one move forward on the riverbank, red's formation would be much better as it would allow better development of the chess pieces.||From this example, we can see that the stability or balance of a formation is not only dependent on the relationships between the chess pieces on the SAME side, IT IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE FORMATION OF THE OPPONENT. Only when your formation is solid, while your opponent's formation is dispersed, can you say that you hold the upperhand in the opening. The reverse wwould be true to.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
