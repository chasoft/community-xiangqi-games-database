[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102021301 be wary of pawn sacrifices||||Sacrificing a pawn to gain allow for faster development of the other chess pieces is an often used tactic in opening. The pawn sacrifice would also allow important positions to be occupied early. Sometimes, a pawn sacrifice is used to control or limit the movement of the opponent's chess pieces. ||Whatever the motive for the pawn sacrifice, the beginner must be wary and think twice. This is because pawn sacrifices are often sudden and relatively unexpected. However, they have grave consequences and should be handled with much care.||In this example, red has started the game with the horse opening.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And the black chariot has managed to occupy an important position on the board that is both beneficial for attack and defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]Red could also choose to play R1+1.||In this way, it would not be to black's advantage if he played P3+1 now, and thus black's intentions  of sacrificing the pawn for positional advantage would be foiled.||Jim: I have added a few more moves to explain to the beginner why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]Jim: say if black decided to continue with his original intentions...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]And black would be in a dilemma. ||Black cannot capture the red pawn as red would gain material with C9=7.||If he did not, his original intentions would have been thwarted and he would not be faced with the issue of this cross river pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]
