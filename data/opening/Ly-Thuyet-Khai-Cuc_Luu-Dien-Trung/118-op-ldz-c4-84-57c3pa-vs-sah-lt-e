[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 84 57c3pa vs sah lt e||第84局五七炮三兵对反宫马左象 ||||ECCO：B55 五七炮互進三兵對反宮馬||ECCO：B55 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement vs Sandwiched Horse Defense with 3rd Pawn Advancement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And we arrive at one of the basic fomrmations of the central cannon versus the sandwiched horse defense.||The Sandwiched horse defense is one of the important that black can choose from against the central cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Moving the left elephant allows black more options in the game to come.||Other commonly played moves include E3+5 and R9+1. ||Red chooses the 57 Cannons with 3rd Pawn Advancement variation to attack black's sandwiched horse defense with left elephant variation, which is the main topic of discussion in this opening.||Other commonly played red moves include C8=6, C8+4 and R9+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Sacrificing the 7th file pawn now and then sending the 3rd file pawn is a commonly used tactic. The main goal is to use the pawns in exchange for an increase in the tempo or lead in the game.||Other then sacrificing the pawns, P5+1/P7+1/R2+6 are also commonly seen.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]If black chose NOT to accept the sacrifice and played R9=8 instead, red would probably be better in most of the ensuing variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]As can be seen in the diagram, this formation was once very popular.||If black chose P3=2, red would have increased his lead. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]R8=9 is also another important variation to know.||Red would be able to hold on to his lead in that variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]E3+5 and R2=4 are also played.||The R2=4 variation will be discussed in the below.||Pls click on the variations below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And it would be a rather even game. There are immediate areas of concern to address for both sides.||In Summary:||Sacrificing both the 3rd and 7th filed pawns is a very important variation in the cc vs sah opening.||It is also a very aggressive and complex variation and had started back in the 1980's. Many masters and GM's have used it and eventually, some of the moves have been fixed as the tabiat for this opening.||From the looks of this variation in actual competition, it would seem to be a rather even game. Both sides would have their hands full.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]And after the sacrifice, red has a very fierce attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]And red would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]And red would still be the aggressor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
