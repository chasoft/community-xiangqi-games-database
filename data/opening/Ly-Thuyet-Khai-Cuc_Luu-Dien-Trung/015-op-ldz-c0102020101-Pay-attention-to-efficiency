[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020101 Pay attention to efficiency||||The efficiency of your moves is something that you have to take note off throughout the entire battle. It is even more prominent in the opening as there are more pieces to manage.||If one can efficiently maneuver the major pieces to the important interesections early, one would have the significant advantage. ||Conversely, if the speed of development of the chess pieces is too slow, it would be very hard to organize a decent attack or form a defensive fortress.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This is a same direction cannons opening variation||Although this would be considered normal development of the chariot, it is not considered to be a good move, because it does not have any specific target to attack. The efficiency of this move would be greatly diminished.||P3+1 in comparison would be a much better move as it is more target specific. Playing P3+1 would allow red to develop his right horse while at the same time slow the development of black's horse in the same file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
