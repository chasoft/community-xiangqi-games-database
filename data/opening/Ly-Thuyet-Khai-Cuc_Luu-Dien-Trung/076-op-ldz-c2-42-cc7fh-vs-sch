[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 42 cc7fh vs sch  ||第42局中炮七路马对屏风马 ||||ECCO：C02 中炮右橫車對屏風馬||ECCO：C02 Central cannnon with right ranked chariot vs Screen Horse Defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red charges the horse forward very early in the game to try to attack the center.||When the horse is advanced so early in the game (early, as in at the expense of the development of the chariots), it is called trailblazer horse or“先锋马”. ||This variation is one of the older variations which is seldom in use nowadays.||The main reason for this is that by advancing the horse so early, red does not give himself much versatility in terms of his attacking or defensive formation. Black would be able to read red's attack better and counter more precisely.||The second reason for the demise of this variation is that the red chariots have delayed development. Black's chariot would be out early and be able to control the important or strategic files/ranks.||The final reason is that this horse is prone to attack or capture by black.||The biggest advantage that this opening has for red is that it is more stable.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This is a time-proven and effective counter by black. It also specifically targets red's riverbank horse.||As red's chariots have not been developed at the expense of this trailblazer horse, black would now concentrate his game plan on further delaying the development of the red chariots or forming a blockade.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Playing R1=2 would be to black's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Red starts to readjust his attacking formation. ||R1=2 would give up control of the game to black now.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]C2=4 is another viable option with red maintaining a minimal lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And it would be a rather even game for both.||In summary, ||after red plays the trailblazer horse, black's game plan would be to target the undeveloped red chariots. Once this is achieved, the solitary trailblazer horse cannot do much on its own as there will be no backup available. ||To a certain extent, this would defeat the purpose of playing H7+6 so early.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]And red is slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]And red's chariots are being severely limited.||Black has snatched control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]And red would not have any major advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]
