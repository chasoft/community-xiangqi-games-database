[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c5 91 cc vs shd ||第91局中炮对单提马 ||||ECCO：B10 中炮對單提馬||ECCO：B10 Central Cannon vs Single Horse Defense||||Jim: This was quite a commonly used opening in the past but has gradually fallen out of favor as a direct counter against the central cannon.||However, with the growing popularity of the Angel's Pawn vs Thundering Defense opening, the single horse defence has slowly caught on again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]As can be seen from the diagram, this is the old form of the Single horse defense. ||It is a very ancient counter. The moves that follow would allow all of black's pieces to be rooted, and this is sometimes called " The Formation of the 7 Jewelled Tree" or“七宝连树”.||While it does have its merits of being completely linked up, there are also innate weaknesses.||Development of the major pieces are delayed and the relative inflexibility of the formation makes it hard to adapt to constant changes on the board, thereby often allowing the opponent advantage. ||In the very first National Singles Competition back in 1956, the single horse defense was torn apart and has gradually declined in popularity and usage.||Modern day Single horse defense has made improvisions, and instead of R9=8, R9+1 is played now.||Please click on the variations to see.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]By using the chariot to patrol the riverbank first before playing H+4, red can prevent black from playing C8+4 to form a blockade.　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red has the obvious advantager.||Red is prepared to play R8+7 and C9+4 for an attack. The one pawn advantage now could also be increased into greater gains for red.||Summary:||One of the biggest flaws of the Single Horse Defense is that when it is used to counter the central cannon, the side horse is played too early, thereby weakening the center and allowing red to attack via the center. This is one of major inadequacies of this counter.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]

[DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]As can be seen from the diagram, black would normally have 4 counters to choose from. They will be introduced below.||1) C8=6 --> red would gain a marked advantage||2) C8=7 --> red would hold the initiative firmly in hand||3) R9=6 --> it would still be to red's advantage||4) R9=4 --> red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]And black'sn ranked chariot would have a hard time getting developed.||Red would have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]And black would regain lost material and actually control the game. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]And red would have increased his initiative.||Jim: The main reason is that black's chariot had made too many moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And red is better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
