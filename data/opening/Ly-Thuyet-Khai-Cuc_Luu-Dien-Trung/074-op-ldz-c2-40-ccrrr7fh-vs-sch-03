[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 40 ccrrr7fh vs sch 03 ||第40局中炮横七路马对屏风马左边炮 ||Black plays the left side cannon variation||||ECCO：C13 中炮右橫車對屏風馬||ECCO：C13 Central cannnon with right ranked chariot vs Screen Horse Defense.中炮右橫車對屏風馬||||Jim: Very lengthy board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Statistical analysis of this side cannon variation has shown that it is a less volatile variation for black, and is one of the most commonly used counters for red' right ranked chariot attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]And red continues his attack by utilizing the left riverbank cannon. With this move, it shows that red has opted for a slow but sure attack instead of a rapid one. Playing the riverbank cannon would allow red more time to deploy his forces to the best possible positions, and slowly build up his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And red would still maintain a slight advantage but black now has a pawn that has crossed the river and is poised to attack an empty right red flank. ||In summary, in this variation for black, the most important issue would be the ability to properly develop the 1r1h1c on his left flank at the best possible time. This would be crucial for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]And Black would have a very defensive formation whereby red would have a hard time cracking.||Jim: of course, black would not have much of an attack either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_28]And black would be better.||Jim:These were the moves given in the manual. I have my own misgivings but I guess it would be impossible to introduce the minor subvariations in greater detail.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]And black would be in control of the game now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]And red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]Jim: threatening to capture the black chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]And it would be a rather even game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And the game would become very complex.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
