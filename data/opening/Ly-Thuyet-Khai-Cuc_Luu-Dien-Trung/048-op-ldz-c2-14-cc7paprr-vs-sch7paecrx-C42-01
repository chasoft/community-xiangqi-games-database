[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 14 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C42||第14局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车黑右横车型（1）  ||||ECCO：C42 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C42 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: This is the beginning of another big subtopic  in the cc vs schecrx saga...||And please do not mistake this variation for the right ranked chariot variation whereby black does not play C8=9 but instead plays R1+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And black raises the black chariot, preparing to traverse it across the board so that the combined efforts of the 2r1h1c combination are able to try to kill the pesky red chariot.||This is another very fierce counter from black, and not one for the weak hearted.||As seen from the diagram, red could choose to play :||1) C8=9 (major variation discussed)||2) P5+1 (and black would have an easier game) ||3) H7+6 (black would be able to turn the tables)||||Jim: This is the variation that will be discussed in this board and the following board. If I remember correctly, I think I have uploaded a few more other openings dedicated to this opening.||This is one of the more aggressive counters by black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Major variation discussed[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Red could also choose to play H7+6 or R3-1 which will be discussed in the next board.||In this variation, red prepares to use his chariot to exchange for two of black's pieces, and try to gain tempo in the process for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And black decides to fight fire with fire. With this R8+8 move, black attacks the weak right flank. Good move![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Correct move. This would allow red to adust his formation and dampen black's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Correct advisor to play!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Red retreats the elephant with style, thereby stalling the entire black attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Advised move! R7+1 would be too trigger happy for black now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And it would be a relatively even game for both sides.||In summary,||in this variation whereby red uses one chariot to exchange for black's horse and cannon is seldom used today. The main reason for this is that the variations are simple and red would have less chances for further gains in the opening.||Black's R8+8 is the key move that sounds the horn for black's counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]Not advised![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]And it is obvious that red is better now. ||Jim: Black has no more offense going on and the black chariot on red's throat rank would need another few more moves to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]Ouch..[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]Checkmate. ||Jim: One wrong advisor move and bam, the game is over.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]Black should not make this move now![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]And red would have be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]Jim: I have added this variation to show the beginner why the black horse is poisoned...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]Jim: And red's chariot would be in a dilemma as to where it should move next. Black would attack the baseline elephant with C7+3 for the check and all hell would break loose.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]Option 2: P5+1[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]And in terms of the development of the chess pieces, black would be faster and have more room to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]And black would preparing to a fast counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_20]
