[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020901 always fight to control the center||The center of the board here refers intersections near the riverbank on the 3rd to 6th files. Relatively speaking, pieces positioned here are generally more powerful and can do much damage or defend better. That is because they are nearer to the king and allow for attack and defense respectively. Also, when any chess piece is positioned at the center of the board, they are more versatile and are more able provide a tightly knit attack/defense with the other chess pieces, as compared to when they are positioned at the sides.||In modern day XiangQi, many of the old openings or counters have been slowly eliminated through the process of evolution. While the reasons are many for the downfall of these openings, one of the most important factors is that the issue of commanding the center had not been addressed sufficiently.||Jim: The GM does not give any examples of these eliminated openings. But a peek through the ancient manuals would show them. And control of the center is also why the central cannon has been the king of openings for centuries.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]The single horse defense was once very popular in the 1950's. If one were to judge the merits of this opening based on the links of the chess pieces and also the balanced nature of it, this counter would score very high. Indeed, this counter was called the The Tree with the Seven Treasures (“七宝连树”).||However, many experts studied it thoroughly and found many ways to exploit the inherent weakness of this opening, causing black to be at a disadvantage most of the time. This is why it is seldom used nowadays as a black counter.||The main problem with this counter is the side horse. It is too far away from the center and would require much effort to develop. This could easily lead black to be even slower in the development of the chess pieces.||Another fallibility is that black's formation was decided too early and the lack of versatility or inadequate adaptations to red's ensuing attack made it especially vulnerable to precise, targeted attacks by red. This was another reason why this opening has slowly been pushed to the brink of extinction. ||Jim: There has been effort to address this issue by black too. Instead of the filed chariot R9=8, black chose to play R9+1 followed by R9=4, breathing life into this counter. Indeed, when red  starts the game with the angel's pawn and proceeds to the central cannon variation, black's thundering defense would often end up with a variant of the single horse defense and it has produced much desirable results. But again, the issue of controlling the center has to be addressed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
