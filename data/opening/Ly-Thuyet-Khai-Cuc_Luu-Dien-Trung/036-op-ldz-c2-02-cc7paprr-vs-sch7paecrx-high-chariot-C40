[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 02 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx high chariot C40||||第02局 中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车黑高车保马型||Central cannon with 7th Pawn Advancement and pawn ranked chariot vs Screen Horse Defense with 7th Pawn Advancement and Edge Cannon for Chariot defence -- high chariot for horse protection variation. ||ECCO：C40 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C40 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: Please note that according to ECCO, this example and the previous example belong to the same variation.||Although this variation is seldom played now, please go through it as certain principles of opening theory are demonstrated.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Playing R8+2 to protect the horse was very fashionable back in the 60's.||However, throughout the decades, the results of this opening were inferior to black playing C9-1 followed by C9=7 immediately, and this variation slowly grew out of favor. Most players choose C9-1 now.||At this point in the game, Red has 2 options to choose from: H8+7 and C8=7. ||The C8=7 will be discussed in this example.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is a relatively new variation. In the past, H8+7 was played. Due to the constraints of this book, we will only list this example and a few subvariations.||Please go through the variations.　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black chooses a more steady approach to the game with this elephant move.||It would be to red's advantage if black played C2-1 instead....||Please click on the variation below...[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Sacrificing the pawn to force the elephant to capture it is a commonly used tactic. This is because after the elephant captures the pawn, black's center would be relatively thin and susceptible to attack from red.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And red carries through his intentions by pushing the central pawn forward.||With this move, black cannot play C2-1 followed by C2=7 now as the attack down the center would prevent that.||This central pawn move also makes room for red's right horse to be developed down the center.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]By playing this move to defend his pawn rank, black's cannon achieves the following:||1) protect the pawn rank, and makes things difficult for red to attack the center directly. It would set the stage up for a counter attack.||2) this move would also allow for black's chariot to be developed with R1=4. If black had played R1=4 directly, red would answer with R9=8 and the plight of this cannon would be something that black would have to take care off immediately.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Pushing the pawn forward for an exchange is the most steadfast move that red can come up with. ||R9=8 is not feasible now!||Click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Jim: Correct order of moves...||This should be played first before R3-2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Red's past two moves have been made in the correct order!!!||Red must play R9=8 first to force horse back to defend.||If red played R3-2 first, black could easily play H8+7 to mount a counter. That way, black would not have needed to play H3-1. ||Click on the variation to understand what would happen should black play R1=2 to protect the cannon ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And red would have control of the game firmly in hand.||As can be seen at this stage, all of red's pieces have been played and the speed of development of these pieces are faster than black's. The positions of the red chess pieces are also much better. ||Although the development of black's pieces do not seem that slow, black's horse and cannon on his right side ( left upper corner of the diagram) are a cause of worry. It would need further play and could easily become a weak point for red to attack.||Short summary: ||In this variation, black plays R8+2 to protect the horse. This was once very fashionable but as time passed, it has slowly been replaced by C9-1. The main reason for this is although black would still have a decent sturdy formation, there is lack of versatility of the chess pieces. The slow speed of development is another reason for its downfall, as it would affect the counter that black could mount. ||　[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red would play H3+5 on the next move to mount an attack from the center.||When the horse is at the center, red could continue with H5+3 to capture or H5+6 to attack.||Black would become very passive.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]And black would now choose to advance his left horse to the riverbank. As this horse has now shouldered the responsibility of threatening with a counter attack, black could leave his right horse on his 3rd file and adjust his play accordingly.||Jim: This is a very important concept that was previously mentioned in the previous example: in the screen horse defense, black must try at all times to have at least one horse mobile for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]Jim: the GM shows why R9=8 is not feasible now![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]And black has the red chariot on his pawn ranked pinned. Black could threaten to gain the chariot with P3+1 on the next move. Red would be in deep trouble, trying to resolve this threat.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]And the fight escalates but it is to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]More commonly played variation in the past....[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]R9+1 is another feasible option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]And it would be relatively even game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_24]
