[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 27 cc7paprr vs sch7palt rbh C37 01||第27局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马左马盘河红平车捉马型||||ECCO：C37 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬左馬盤河||ECCO C37 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement and left Riverbank Horse Variation||Jim: Ok, here is it. Another very very very very big variation in the screen horse defense, and one of my personal favorites.||There are tooooooooo many variations in this opening but the GM has done a fantastic job of presenting the major ones![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]C8+3 would be to black's advantage!||Jim: Click on the variation to see why!　[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]As seen from the diagram, red has many options to choose from:||1) R2=4||2) C8+2||3) R2-2||4) P5+1||5) C8+1||6) C8=9||7) R9+1||||Variations 1) R2=4 , 2) C8+2 and 3) R2-2 will be discussed in this board. The rest of the variations would be discussed in the boards to come.||A point to note: after years of trials, variations C8+2 and R2-2 are found to be inadequate, disallowing red control of the game, and are seldom used nowadays.||Jim: Heck, and the GM tells me now...[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Variation 1) R2=4||Directly threatening to capture the horse is one of the earliest variations and is one of the more steadfast ones. It has survived through time and is still one of the most commonly used variations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]This is one of the better counters for black. ||If black tried C8=7, red would ans with C5=6 and red would have the better formation and the lead firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Black retreats the horse to advance this pawn across the river! Ingenious move.||Black would now attempt to gain an elephant to try to keep the game balanced.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And black can be satisfied with this outcome, having gained an elephant in the trade-off.||In summary, in this variation, red's formation can be criticized as too stable and lacking aggression. Although black would have a hard time trying to attack, red would not be able to bring down black's defenses that easily too.||After this move, for black, the immediate issue to address would be how the left chariot would be used to alleviate the pressure on his right flank. The game would center around this issue. If black is unable to do so, red's attack on black's right flank would increase in momentum.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And red would be better.||Jim: As can be seen, the development of red's pieces are much better and faster than black's.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]Variation 2) C8+2||Not good for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]And both sides would have immediate areas of concerns to address, but black would have the easier time of the two.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_13]Variation 3)R2-2||Bad for red's health.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]And black would be slightly better off!||Jim: Black now threatens to play H4+5 on the next move. The two black chariots are in the open and black generally has more space to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]And although red has more pawns, the development of the chess pieces is far inferior to black!||Black's game![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
