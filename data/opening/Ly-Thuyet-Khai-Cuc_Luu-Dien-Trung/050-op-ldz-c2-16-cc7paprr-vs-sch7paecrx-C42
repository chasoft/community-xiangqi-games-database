[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 16 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C42||第16局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红卸炮左肋型   ||||ECCO：C42 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C42 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||||Jim: Please refer to the previous board before you start this one.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]In this variation, red deliberately moves his central cannon away from the center to adjust his formation early on. ||This is a rather rare variation, but if your opponent was not familiar with the tricks and traps, red would be able to gain advantage very easily!||Jim: Please refer to the annotated game published on 2012/10/08. It is a similar example of such an opening. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]As seen from the diagram, black charges the horse forward to gain a lead in the numbner of moves played. It could also threaten to chase the pesky red chariot away.　||Jim: By this, GM Liu meant that red had moved his central cannon two times which would be equivalent to moving that piece once.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And black goes for practical gains by taking the pawn. If black played E3+5 now, red would be in the advantage.||Jim: Please click on the variation below to understand it. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And black advances the chariot! Good move!||Black gets to play R8=6 to offer an exchange of chariots and thus adjust his formation accordingly. If red refused the exchange, black's chariot would gain control of that rib file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black offers to exchange the chariot. According to the rules, if neither side changes their moves, it would be a draw.||In Summary,||Black's H7+8 and R8+2 are the key moves in this variation. Red has intended to focus his attack on black's right side (left on the board) and black has countered with this exchange offer.||Jim: NICE![/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
