[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c4 89 56c left proper horse vs sah||第89局五六炮正马对反宫马 ||||ECCO：B43 五六炮左正馬對反宮馬||ECCO：B43 56 Cannons with Left Proper Horse vs Sandwiched Horse Defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And we arrive at the basic formation for discussion in this example.||Red has started his opening with the 56 Cannons with left proper horse opening, while black has countered with the sandwiched horse opening.||The characteristic of this opening is that red would have a very closely knit and stable formation. This would slow the pace of the game. The downside for red would be the much slower pace of development of the left chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]As can be seen in the diagram, black's chariot has started to attack red's pawn rank. This is one of the newer variations over the past few years.||In the past black would play P7+1, which would most often lead to a complicated game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]This is the key move for black to make to prevent red from launching an attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]And it would be an even game.||Summary:||Using the 56 Cannons aganst the sandwiched horse defense has always been one of the more popular choices and is a favorite of players who prefer a slower but more deliberate pace of attack.||Black's R2+6 is a relatively new issue to address for red.||The way that red deals with this R2+6 move would be instrumental in later development of the other pieces.||More study is needed in this opening.　　[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]And both sides would have their worries.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_26]
