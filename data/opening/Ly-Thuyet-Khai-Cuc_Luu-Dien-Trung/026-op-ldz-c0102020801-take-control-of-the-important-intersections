[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020801 take control of the important intersections||In the opening stages of the game, after some maneuvering by both sides, there would appear important positions/files/ranks on the board. Needless to say, the side that is able to control these positions/files/ranks would have a significant advantage, and would often weaken the opposing side. In a nutshell, occupying these positions/files/ranks would mean controlling the game.||Two examples are given here to demonstrate this point.||In this example, red started the game with the 57 cannons while black countered with the 3rd pawn advancement variation of the screen horse defense. ||Red's turn to move.||R9+1 is one of the most commonly played moves at this stage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Most often played move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]This file is the only file left of the board that would allow development of the chariot. It is also a very important file to control as it would it would greatly hamper the opponent's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]This was the move played in an actual game.||The weakness and inadequacies of this move are shown.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_8]At this point, if red chose to capture the black horse with R8-1, black would play H6+4 to gain control of the game and have the significant lead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]After black's sacrifice, black would now have control of the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]
