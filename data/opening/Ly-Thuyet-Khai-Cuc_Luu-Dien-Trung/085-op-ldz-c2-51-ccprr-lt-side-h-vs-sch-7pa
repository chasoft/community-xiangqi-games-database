[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 51 ccprr lt side h vs sch 7pa||第51局中炮边马过河车对屏风马7卒 ||||ECCO：C19 中炮過河車左邊馬對屏風馬||ECCO：C19 Central cannon with pawn ranked chariot and left side horse vs screen horse defense[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]As can be seen, after red advances the chariot, the basic formation of this opening is now set: red's central cannon with pawn ranked chariot and left side horse variation vs black's screen horse defense with 7th pawn advancement.||This opening was very popular in the 1950's and 60's and gradually reached its peak in the 1970's.  It fell out of favor to the other cc variations.||But in today's world, more and more players are starting to pick it up again and has thus far injected new life into this opening. ||It can be seen now and then in the National Competitions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This is a must make move for black.||Plying C8=9 or P3+1 now would allow red to increase his advantage in the game.||Jim: pls click on the variation below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]The ranked chariot is an improvised move.||In the past R2-2 was played and red would lose control fo the game. ||Jim: Pls click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]P7+1 is a possible alternative which would lead to an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Black must charge the pawn now or lose material should he play R1=2 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black would lose much if H6-7 were played instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Red would hold the slight lead if black played R1+1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Red would fall into black's trap should red move C6=4 now![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And it would be an attacking game for both.||In summary:||Red's left side horse and pawn ranked chariot variation has shown to be statiscally inefficient in the past, and has not received the results that red would want, thereby leading to a decrease in its usage.||In the past few years however, many young players have studied and greatly enriched the content of this opening.||The variations shown here are all from actual games played.||From the looks of things, this opening would still have much room for study in the years to come.  　[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]And black is much better!||Black would now threaten to gain material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]And red is slightly better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]And red is much better in terms of position and development of the chess pieces![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]And black is going to lose material with the impending red chariot fork.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]And it would be a rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]And black's pieces are much more lively and developed with better positioning.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_19]And now both of red's chariots are on black's pawn rank. The pressure applied by these two chariots give red a huge lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]And red is much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_13]
