[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0102020201 Never move a single piece too many times||Another important principle to adhere to in the opening is NEVER to move a single piece too many times.||The biggest reason is that this would affect the development of the other chess pieces. A balanced development would thus be impossible and this would go against the basic tenets of opening theory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]The variation cited above was quite fashionable in the 1960's.||Although red would have gained two extra pawns, it is obvious that his chess pieces are underdeveloped, especially the left red chariot. ||On the other hand, black has already moved his pieces, and they are very versatile.||Basically black has already seized control of the game from red.||The main reason for red's demise is that red's chariot had taken up 5 moves, and the central pawn  2 moves.||This would be the main reason why red is unable to obtain a balanced development.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
