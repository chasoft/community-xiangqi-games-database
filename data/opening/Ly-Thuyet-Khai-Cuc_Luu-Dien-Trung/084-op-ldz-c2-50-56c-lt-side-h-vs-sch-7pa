[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Jim: This is the major variation that is discussed in this board. It is still sometimes seen in actual competition.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And as can be seen from the diagram, after red plays the palcorner cannon, the opening is basically fixed:||the 56 Cannons with Left Side Horse variation vs the screen horse defense.||It is a fashionable opening.||The main character of this opening is that is less aggressive and is much slower paced, with more emphasis on the deployment of forces. ||The advantage gained is accumulated in small amounts. 　[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Playing C8+4 would be to red's slight advantage. Red would also have more pawns.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black could also choose to play:||1. R8+6 --> red wold be better||2. R8+1 --> and an even game would result.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]E3+5 could also be played to keep the game in a standoff state.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]A rather even game.||In summary: ||in this opening, it is easy to reach a standoff. ||The ability to deploy your pieces to slowly gain the lead is perhaps the most crucial factor and it is the only way to win. ||As compared to some of the earlier, more aggressive variations, in this variation, the ability to read the game and make more long term plans is perhaps more important.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]A rather even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]And red would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]And it would be an even game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]And red would have the significant pawn advantage and be slightly better off.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
