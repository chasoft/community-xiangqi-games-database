[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c2 20 cc7paprr vs sch7paecrx C41||第20局中炮七兵过河车对屏风马平炮兑车红五七炮型||ECCO：C41 中炮過河車互進七兵對屏風馬平炮兌車||ECCO C41 Central Cannon with Pawn Ranked chariot and 7th Pawn Advancement vs Screen Horse Defense 7th Pawn Advancement with Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation||Red tries the 57 Cannons variation.||||Jim: This board can be thought of a continuation of the 56 Cannons introduced previously.The 57 Cannons is a very big topic in Xiangqi itself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]By playing the 57 cannons, red prepares to charge P7+1 across the river. This is one of the more proactive approaches to the game.||However, in the 1950's, black's screen horse defense was able to handle this attack with ease and for a period of time, this variation was shelved and it disappeared for quite some time.||However, as opening studied evolved, players learnt more about this variation and made adjustments accordingly, therey breathing life into this variation again. It is now often played in competition again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This is the key move for black to answer red's aggressions. With this single move, black threatens to capture the red chariot with C9=7 and instantly allows ALL the black pieces room to maneuver.　Key move!!!||Jim: Black denies red a target to attack and also threatens to remove the pesky red chariot with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Of course red would not be willing to play R3-1 to escape, because black would be better!||Please click on the variation below to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]In the 1950's black once tried to play P7+1. ||Please click on the variation below to see it! ||Jim: The variations listed show quite a bit of history in the evolution of this game.　[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Black thinks far ahead with this move.||When the black chariot is in the throat file, red's chess pieces are stifled, thereby slowing the movement of the red chess pieces that have not been played.Red would have to think twice if he wanted to try a blitzkrieg attack.　||C2=5 is not advised now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]And black would be the one attacking.||Black's consecutive movement of the cannon continuously is brilliant, thereby sounding the horn for a fierce counter.||In summary:||There is still much room for study and development in this variation, and more work to be done to prove its validity.||In my humble opinion, red should not have played R3=5 (move 9) to take the central pawn, as it most probably be detrimental to red's development in general.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]And the palcorner horse is well developed and ready to join in the attack. Black would not gain much from C2=5 in retrospect now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]This was the move that was played in the past.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_28]And after the sacrifice, black has a seething attack going on. This is the reason why red's C8=7 nearly went into extinction. ||But red has found new ways of attack. ||Jim: Please compare the variations after move 9 (black plays P7+1) to get a hang of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]This is the reason why this opening started becoming alive again!||And it is a very power counter against black's ||P7+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]And red has now the huge advantage in the game, after the sacrifice.||And this variation is why black gave up on P7+1 on the 9 th move, to play R1=2 instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]And Black would be in total control of the game!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]Not good.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]And black can play C9=7 or R8+6 on the next move, and would be much faster in the development of his pieces in general. Black can be satisfied with this outcome![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]
