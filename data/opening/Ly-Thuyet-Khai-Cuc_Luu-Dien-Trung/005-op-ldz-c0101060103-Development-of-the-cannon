[DhtmlXQ_comment0]op ldz c0101060103 Development of the cannon||||3) Development of the Cannon||The cannon is a long distanced attacking piece. Because of its nature, it is bestowed upon the ability to control other pieces from afar, and is quite a good chess piece at providing linkage amongst the other pieces. All this, of course, would require a cannon mount. ||That is why, in the opening stages, the cannon should occupy important positions on the board and do not move simply, or it might actually decrease the efficiency of it. ||In certain openings, the cannon is sometimes used to as the first piece to form a blockade (like black's cannon which is used to play C8+4 in the left cannon blockade counter). It can be used to advance slowly like the 8th file cannon in red's variation of the 58 cannon vs screen horse defense. ||And it can be very effectively used as a weapon of attack with the discovered attack tactic. The double cannons in black's double pawn ranked cannon variation of the screen horse defense exemplifies this. ||As can be seen from the board on the left, red has utilized the Central Cannon with 3rd Pawn Advancement Opening. Black, has countered with the Sandwiched Horse Defense. Both are orthodox openings and both chariots have decent files/ranks for development. And both sides have advanced at least a pawn to facilitate development of one horse. And last but not least, both sides have cannons in advantageous positions and do not move simply.||This would be a relatively equal game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
