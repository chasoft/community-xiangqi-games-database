[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120804 GM Yang Guanlin 03||||This was an actual game played by Yang in the 1957 National Singles Championships. Guangdong's Yang Guanlin took on famed Shanghai player Zhu Jianqiu. Yang started the game with the Riverbank variation of the Central Cannon while Zhu answered with the Screen Horses. This was what the game looked like at move 19. ||It was red's turn. Black is threatening to capture the red horse.||What would you do if you were GM Yang?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]!!!||This game showed GM Yang's superb precision when attacking. After in-depth analysis, GM Yang sacrificed his horse to charge the pawn across the river for an all out attack on black's right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Black cannot play R2-1...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Jim: This move showed Yang's brilliance. Black would have to play R2+1 and thus it would be an exchange of one chariot for two horses. Yang would thus gain momentum in the game. In retrospect, black's capturing of the horse actually blocked his own chariot (the one on the bottom rank), and caused much instability to his defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Another superb play from Yang! Red sacrifices his cannon to pry open black's defenses! What boldness!||Jim: And black's defense crumble to pieces after this move as you will see.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Jim: Black tried to mount a last offense...[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Red won. This was the last move given...||Jim: The following moves explain why this was a red victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]And black would have nothing left. If the black chariot left this rib file, red would simple go for the double chariots checkmate. If it did not, red would simply capture the chariot and then massacre red for the win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_6]Jim: This is my analysis. If black tried for an exchange...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]Red would simply refuse it, and still maintain his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_11]And red would still have the material upperhand and be not far away from a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_5]And black would still have a hard time!!!||This was a very good example of threatening with a discovered attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_5]
