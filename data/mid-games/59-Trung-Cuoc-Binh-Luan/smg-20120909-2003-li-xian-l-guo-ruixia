[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120909 01 2003 Li Xian L Guo Ruixia||?? ?? ???||||This were some of the midgames discussed in one of the 2003 editions of <<??>>. ||Today's 3 selected games were played by female competitors and commented by GM Zhang Guofeng.||Her comments should allow you to take a peek into the minds of a GM.          ||"The Chinese National Xiangqi Championships (females section) was held in Wuhan. The following three boards were selected from the competition for the reader to enjoy.   ||In this example, Zhejiang's Li Xian went up againse Sichua's Guo Ruixia. From the look of things, one can deduce that red had utilized the central cannon opening with rapid central pawn adavancement variation. Black had countered with the screen horse defence, choosing the edge cannon for chariot exchange variation. ||In this sort of opening, it gets very complicated very easily early into midgame and both sides usually fight it out fist for fist, at this stage. And because of such a characteristic, emphasis would be on the ability to find opportunities and the ability to calculate precisely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red draws's first blood with this move. This is considered to be an aggressive variation.||A more subtle alternative would be to play C7+8 ...||||Please click on the variation below to see GM Zhang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black did not play H3+5 but made this move instead. This would seem a little bit too rash. Perhaps black underestimated red's attacking capabilities or overestimated the pontential of his concentrated forces on red's right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]And red accepted black's challenge, after seeing the opportunity presented. Red draws first blood by pouncing on the central elephant.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This horse sacrifice is a continuation of the P5+1 move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Perhaps a better move would be to play H7+8. ||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Moving the cannon to this file would allow red to :||a) develop his left chariot||b) threaten black with H7+6 and R4=5.||However, the "speed" of this move is too slow, allowing black a chance to come back into the game.||A better move would R9=8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]And red misses his opportunity with this move. This is the pivotal move that cost red the game. ||Jim: GM Zhang had no suggestions though.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]After a series of exchanges, red's most threatening piece on the board, the red central horse has been eliminated. The red cannon on red's 6th file and left chariot are basically functionless.||At this stage, black has already took control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Black wins.||For beginner, red can only resolve this checkmate with C4-7, and black would checkmate with C7+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]no no no...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]Black is attacking the red chariot now..[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_18]And black threatens with a double cannon checkmate should red play K5+1.||Red would have to play R4-3 and lose that chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_11]GM Zhang's recommendation.||This would hasten the development of the left chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]At this stage, both of red's chariots and horses are well positioned. Red has better positioning.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_16]And red would be in trouble...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]And red would gain development of his left chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_11]and red would still have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_8]Why black cannot make this move![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_9]And red would gain back material, together with control of the game. Black would be in a predicament.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_1]Variation suggested by GM Zhang.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_7]And red would be able to foil black's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_7]
