[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120701 unlinking the elephants 01||In Xiangqi the elephants can only move 7 points on their side of the board. But as they are able to be linked up, they can be used to provide defense. And in many cases, breaking the linkage of the elephants or preventing the elephants from moving to one side of the board to help defend is the first essential stage in attacking your opponent. One of the most commonly used tactics to break up the linkage of the elephants is to place a chess piece, usually a chariot by virtue of its mobility at the elephant eye. ||The following are a few examples I found on the net that shows how the chariot is used to 'unlink' the elephant for the final kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]!!!||Black begins the attack with by preventing the red elephant red elephant from being able to play E5-7. ||The horse sacrifice is well worth it as the cannons are able to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Red falls for the trap...||In retrospect, maybe red should not have taken the  horse but if did not, black could play H6+4 and red would still be under heavy attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Another important move!||Red gives no chance of a breather as he is determined to crack red's defenses![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Black wins after capturing the red cannon with C4-1...[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
