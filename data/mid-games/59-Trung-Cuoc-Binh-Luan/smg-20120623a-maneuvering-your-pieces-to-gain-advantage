[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120623a maneuvering your pieces to gain advantage||There is a big problem with the terms in Xiangqi, or english terms in Xiangqi that is. Basically, in the course of actual play, you maneuver your chess pieces. However, maneuvering in Xiangqi has a more specific context, that is any move that does not exchange or sacrifice.||I have yet to find a better term for it...sigh.||Anyway, how well you maneuver your chess pieces is a sign of your Xiangqi prowess, and although easy to learn, the art of maneuvering your chess pieces is very very hard to master. ||In this exampl,e black has more pawns but the positions of the major chess pieces is ver bad. If red were able to focus on this weakness, red could exploit it by maneuvering his chess pieces for the final win. Red first![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]!!! An offer to start the game! Red threatens to checkmate with R2+8 should black accept the sacrifice.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]And one threat is eliminated. Red continues to harass the black cannon with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]!!! Great move. ||Red prepares for the Tiger silhouette checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And just after a few moves, red has manuevered his chess pieces preparing for a kill, and even managed to push a pawn across the river. There is a threat of a checkmate at any time. ||Red has turned the tables and is poised for a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
