[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120602a Exchanging for initiative ||||Another nice file I find on the internet.||Exchanging your chess pieces to gain intiative or control of the game is one of the most basic strategies that you can have. As in actual play, seldom does your opponent make big mistakes, one of the ways of gaining an advantage in the game is to gain control of major positions through means of an exchange. The ultimate goal of winning the game remains the same. ||In this example, black uses the tactic of exchanging pieces to try to gain control of the game.||Black first. ||According to the info given, this was an actualg game played but the players or other relevant information pertaning to the game was not given.||An intial analysis shows that red is prepared to gain material by capturing the black cannon. If the black cannon runs away say C2-6 or any other move, red would play R1=6 and be in control of the important ranks and files in the game.||How can black turn the tables? ||There does not seem to be any move that can win the game immediately for red...so what can black do?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]!!! Black forces an exchange of the chariots and positions his cannon to a much better place in the process. This would be better and more proactive than C2=8 or retreating the cannon. ||With this move, red's defense is busted open.||Key move!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Just within 2-3moves, black now has a central cannon, prevented the chariot from attacking his weak right side and has considerably limited the movement of red's chess pieces on red's right flank. ||It is obvious that black has the upper hand now. ||Red has no choice but to accept the exchange or he would lose his left chariot, which would also be to black's advantage.||Now let us see how black increases his control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Preparing to capture the red cannon...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Good move! Black does not allow the red horse or chariot to leave the right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And black initiates another exchange to simplify the game to his advantage.||At this point in the game, it is obvious as to who has the upperhand!||Although each sides have 1r1h1c, black has 5 menacing pawns ready to attack. There is much room to maneuver for all of black's pieces, while red's chess pieces are either pinned or in badly positioned with little room for movement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
