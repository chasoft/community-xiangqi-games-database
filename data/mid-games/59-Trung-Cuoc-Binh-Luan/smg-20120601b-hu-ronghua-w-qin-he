[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120601b Hu Ronghua W Qin He ||||GM Hu takes on Qin He from Inner Mongolia in this game. Hu had started the game with his famed elephant opening and Qin had answered with the left central cannon. After 41 moves, we arrive at this board. ||A quick analysis shows that both parties are similar in material but black has one extra pawn. However, black's horses, although linked, are pinned by red's chariot. GM Hu makes use of this weakness and exploits it brilliantly to gain material for the final win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Brilliant central pawn sacrifice!||This would allow red to play C6-3 and then C6=3 to attack black's horses![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black cannot play R2+1 now...||Please click on the variation to understand why![/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]After a few rounds, red attacks and defends brilliantly at the same time. Red has the upperhand both in material and position.||Red would eventually.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]And red would have eliminated all possible threats  from black. Black's horse cannot take red's central pawn or red would simply skewer it with R2=5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]
