[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120622b the use of the king in midgame||||In Xiangqi, the king is the ultimate target for attack. And more often than not, it requires protection from the other chess pieces and can be a liability. ||However, in specific situations, they are able to participate in attack like in the iron bolt checkmate with respect to the rule that the kings cannon face each other in the same file without any intervening pieces. The king can also sometimes be used to block the cannon or the horse  and thus slowing the opponent's attack while saving himself, buying time for his other troops to attack.||In this game, red is under heavy attack. However, by moving the red king, red actually turns the tables around!||Red first...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red abruptly sacrifices the horse to let move the red king to safer grounds. By doing so, the effects of the black central cannon are deleted and red's chariots are actually more threatening!||This king move actually ignites red's the 2r2c attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Great move! This chariot move does much. ||1) it allows red to attack the center with the 2 cannons and/or||2) it threatens black with a possible double chariots checkmate.||3) it can join forces with the red side cannon to attack black's empty right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]At this stage, in the game, red now threatens to gain back a horse. The central file is now controlled by the red cannon, and red has the ever present threat of R4+3/R4=5 should the black horse move away![/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]red cannot forget to defend![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]and red cannot forget to defend either![/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]checkmate.||Red's K5=4 on the first move not only saves his own king and sets red up for the final smothered chariot checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]

[DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]if red forgot to defend and trudged ahead instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_17]

[DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]nope![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]And red is sure to win now!||Red has an immediate kill with R5+1 and for black to resolve this threat, the black horse would be lost, which would eventually be a red win also.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]nope....[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]And red would win on the next move with R6+1/R4+1 or R4=5 depending on how black reacts![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]
