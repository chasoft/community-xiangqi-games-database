[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120909 03 2003 He Jing L Zhang Guofeng ||This was a game that I had played in the same competition.||Red was He Jing while I took black. ||As seen from this diagram, which pawn would you take?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]This is perhaps the move that cracked red's defences. It is also one of the most important moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Although black is one major piece down, the two cross river pawns have a certain amount of attacking capabilities. Besides, their positioning are superb and they would more than make up for the lost horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Ideal move. This is better than R2=3. ||Please click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red is forced to counter sacrifice. This is perhaps the toughest counter that red can come up with. ||Please click on the variation to understand what would happen if red tried to play H3-1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]I was a little bit rash to have accepted red's offer. In retrospect, R2=3 would have allowed me better control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]I cannot play R2=4 for the exchange now!!! The advisor cannot be moved either...[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]C7+7 would not be a good alternative now.||Click on the variation to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This is a good move from red, allowing herself more options.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Perhaps K5=6 would be a much better move for red at this stage.  ||Please click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Playing this move now would not be good!  ||Please click on the variations of the moves below.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Please refer back to red's C7-2 move at move 13 and you will understand why it was not good.||Because red had played C7-2, black's cannon can know escape capture.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]At this stage, red was one major piece down and was on the receiving end, it was just a matter of time before red would lose.||The final moves have been omitted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]And black would be denied  a chance to play R2=4 now!!!||I have added a few more moves to explain to the beginner why![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]Jim: Say black insisted on making this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]And red would gain another cannon and enter the endgame with superior material advantage against a black side without any defensive pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]As the positioning of red's chariots have changed, black could choose to defend in this way.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]And the black central horse defends superbly, denying red another immediate kill.||It could still be anybody's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]Better move for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]Why this is not feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]And red would gain material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]Also not a feasible move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]And without any advisors or elephants, black would be at the wrath of the two red chariots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]Now the two red chariots are on the same file, making the double chariots checkmate impossible.||Black could now force an exchange with R2=4 when possible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]And red would run out of steam. There would be not much of an attack left...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]And black would be threatening to checkmate with the chariots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_14]And Red would win after capturing my chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_13]Why this move is not feasible too....[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]And red has successfully forced the the black chariot back to the bottom rank and has a very strong attack going on. Red has the option of C7=3 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_8]Why red cannot retreat the horse!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_15]And red's horse at on the sideline is practically functionless. Her left horse is also under heavy attack. Things do not look good for red now![/DhtmlXQ_comment10_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_7]Not so ideal order of moves...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_12]Please compare this variation with the actual one played. ||Red would have C8=7 as a threat now to skewer and even kill. This would not have happened if black had played P7+1 instead.||The order of moves are very important.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_6]And red would fork the two chariots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_2]And red's chariot now controls the riverbank. Red would also have a H7+8 threat ready. ||Black would have been in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_2]
