[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120622c the use of the advisor and elephant in midgame||||Most of the time, the advisor and elephants act as defenders. However, they can be used to hinder the opponent's attack to set up an attack of his own in specific situations. Indeed, in certain very special circumstances, the advisor and the elephant can actually participate in attack.||One of the more commonly used tactic involving the elephant is the "General Disrobing" tactic or "????". The advisor and elephant can also act as cannon mounts to actually capture chess pieces within their spehere of influence with discovered checks.||In this actual game played, red has made a sacrifice and is mounting an attack . Black seems to have the material upperhand but the bottom ranked chariot is indirectly pinned by the red cannon. ||Black's turn...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]With this advisor move, the threat of the red cannon is dissipated and the black king is allowed to join in the attack by controling the central file. A good multi-purpose move![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
