[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130407 02 Jing XueYi L Yu YouHua||??? ?? ???||||This was a match played in the 20th round. Red was Master Jing XueYi while Black was ZheJiang's GM Yu YouHua.||Red would seem to have the extra central pawn and also a reasonable stoic formations, but red's chariot has limited room to move. Black's cannons on the 3rd and 7th file are also very menacing, applying much pressure to red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Black adjusted his formation with this move. It also increased the mobility of the black cannons and is an often used maneuvering tactic.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Red was having a hard time in the game at this point in time.||His remaining chariot was responsible for defending against black's horse on the riverbank.||His cannon on the 6th file could not move or leave that file simply or C7+4 would create much trouble.  ||A5-4 to relieve the pressure by the black cannon may be a plausible alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Knowing that black's cannon is now ready to move to his right, red moves the advisor, to make way for his chariot for development and defense.||Unfortunately, this would cause disruption in red's defense on the right flank.||It would seem to be an empty move.||A5-4 is still recommended as red's formation would be tougher.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Black forces red's hand with this move, thereby allowing himself to counter red's answer more precisely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red cannot move the advisor now or his chariot would be trapped.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And black's cannon immediately attacks red's third file again!||Very versatile move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]This would seem to be hasty play from red, and in retrospect, this move would seem to be the move responsible for red's loss.||E7+5 is recommeded as red would still be able to force a draw after his cannon plays C6-2 for defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Black's cannon does not attack the elephant with C3+9. Instead, black gradually adjusts his formation to lauch an all out attack.||Wily and experienced play![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And red's ramhorn advisors finally prove troublesome for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Both red and black relieved some time pressure with the previous few moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]And red's defense is in ruins. A defeat can be the only outcome.||The rest of the moves have been omitted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]Jim: This move was added to explain the GM's comments.||Say red's palcorner cannon left his cannon rank...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]And black would be prepared to play C3=7 to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
