[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121218 01 Tao HanMing L Xie Kui||In the first ever A league match, this battle took place in round 11. ||JiLin Province's GM Tao HanMing (Jim: who later rendered his services to HeiLongJiang) took on Huo  Che Tou's Master Xie Kui ??. We start off with red making the first move.||Jim: Did a little bit of research. Master Xie Kui was born in 1973, and is a native of ShanDong Province. He is currently (till 2010 at least) coach and chief player of the ShanDong Team, and once achieved a very respectable rating of 2556 in 2010.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red had not read the game well. H3+2 would be better![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]And Master Xie starts his game with a horse sacrifice! A very powerful move.||Master Xie Kui has been on a roll and was in top form. He had defeated GM Xu Yinchuan in last year's National Singles Championships. ||Now facing GM Tao, his warrior spirit was very much evident in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]If red chose to play H4-5, black would have countered with R7+9 and red would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]A nice move to control the game!||Black does not hurry to regain lost material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Although black's horse would simply charge forward  , red is left with not many choices.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black shows that he has read the game very well. He knows that he could easily regain lost material, and chose to develop his horse instead. ||Once this horse is able to get close enough to the palace, black's attack would be fearsome and hard to deal with.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]A very tightly knit move![/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]This is the most stubborn defense that red can offer.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Good move.||After moving the king out of harm's way (Jim: red threat of a smothered cannon checkmate), the king would be able to help black out in the attack. .||Red's 1r1c on black's right flank would not be sufficient for a kill.||Black is sure to win now from this stage on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Red resigned and black won the game.||Jim: for beginners, red would lose the chariot after black plays C8-1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]And black would be sure to win now![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]And black would not be far from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]And black would be sure to capture the red chariot for the win![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]And red would still lose material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_12]And red would be very wary of black's ability to gain material with the discovered check (1r1c) and would not dare to move his pieces simply.||Black on the other hand would now focus on attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]And once the left red horse is able to join in the attack, it could be anybody's game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
