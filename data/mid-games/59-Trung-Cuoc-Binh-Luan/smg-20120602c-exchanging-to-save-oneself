[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120602c Exchanging to save oneself||||Many a times, when you are on the losing end of a game, one tactic to use is to exchange chesspieces so that the opponent's threats are removed. Sometimes, it could even win the game for you. ||In this game, red is under attack. Black's horse is threatening to go for an elbow horse check. And the other black pieces have more or less pinned the red chess pieces. ||Let us see how red turns the tables.||Red first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Correct move. ||Red sacrifices the pawn to eliminate the threat of the black cannon. ||If black's cannon were allowed to move to red's pawn rank, red would be in serious trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]If black played P3+1, it would still to be red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]This is to prevent black from playing H4+3 immediately. Red identifies this threat correctly and puts a stop to it.||Suddenly, black's cannon and horse are much less menacing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And now there is no immediate threat of a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]!!!||Brilliant![/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And suddenly, red has a menacing attack of his own after exchanging or rather sacrificing his chariot for black's cannon. ||Red is now on the attack and black is on the defending side. ||Red's tactic of exchanging the chess pieces is successful.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]And red would still be able to get himself out of this predicament with an exchange of chess pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_2]And black would threatening to gain at least one chariot with this move.||Black is already skewering the red chariot and cannon and H4+3 would guarantee that black wins at least one chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_2]
