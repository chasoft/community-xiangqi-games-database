[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120712d threatening to capture your opponent chess pieces mm xqzsjc fbszzy 026||This game was played decades ago when Thailand's Liu Boliang took on Philipines Gong Jiaxiang.||A quick look at the board shows that black has the upperhand but it would still take some effort for black to win....[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]And red underestimates the threat of black's offense with this move.||Perhaps C7=5 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]And Black pounces on the chance given.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Cannot take the black chariot or black would mate with R7+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And black plays the horse to go for the white horse showing hooves checkmate. For beginners who do not know what this kill is, please go to the basic kills section.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]The horse is now in place. ||Black needs to think of a way to maneuver his chariot to his 4th file for the kill to materialize, while at the same time defending against the central red chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]A desperate move by red, trying to give the central chariot a root, and to defend against the White Horse showing Hooves checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]The chariot is now in place for the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Red is forced to play this move to guard against H2-4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black threatens to capture the cannon again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Again, by threatening to capture black's chariot, black would play R1=4 on the next move for the kill!||Black wins.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]And black is guaranteed a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]
