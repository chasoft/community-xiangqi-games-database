[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130127 01 Li Xian L Han Bing|| ||Jim: This is a continuation of commented analyses by GM Zhang GuoFeng in her column a few years back in the periodical QiYi. In today's upload, three boards from the 2004 National Team Championships, Female's section are analyzed. ||Zhejiang's Li Xian took on HuoCheTou's Han Bing is the first board to be discussed.||||GM Zhang: As seen from the figure, this was the midgame reached when ZheJiang's Li Xian took on HuoCheTou's Han Bing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red advances the cannon to limit the moving space of the black chariot. The main idea is to attack black's horse on the third file. ||It shows the aggression of the young player.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]A natural move to make. This is also a continuation of black's riverbank cannon move a few moves earlier.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And red advances his 3rd pawn to try to disrupt the defensive formation of black's riverbank cannon. A very proactive move.||However, this would eventuall lead to an attack on on flank by each player with a cross river pawn, and red would not be able to control the situation. ||Red should have played P7+1.?[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Red has to retreat the horse, but H3-5 would be better.||If red had played H3-5, her pieces would be concentrated and her horses would be able to be developed via the other side of the board. H3-5 would also provide more versatility to the game as red would be able to adjust her formation much better.||Playing H3-1 would be in effect moving the horse into back into a corner, and red's chess pieces would seem very dispersed now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And black shows much versatility and flexibility with this move. Black can now develop her horse via the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]After advancing the chariot, black would surely play H8=6 for a chariot exchange. ||If red accepts the exchange, red would not seem to have many attacking options left.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And red is forced to accept the exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And red is also forced to retreat the chariot to the riverbank, or black would be prepared to play C8-3 on the next move to gain material.||Jim: For beginners, the red chariot is now rooted, so if black does indeed, play C8-3, it would be an exchange of material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Black's defensive formation is rather firm and solid. There are not many obvious targets to attack for red. That is why red played this move to try to disrupt the stability of black's defense, hoping that weaknesses would appear.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]At this point in time, we would see that each player has a cross river pawn. ||An important issue would be to develop the potential of their cross river pawns now. It would seemt hat black's cross river pawn has limited the movement of red's side horse.||And although red's cross river pawn is not an immediate threat at the moment, it can combine with the red cannon and chariot for attack. The potential threat of this cross river red pawn is also high.||From a general outlook of the game, black's chariot is still poorly positioned and that would be an area of concern for black.||That is why, the focus of the game now would be on this black chariot.||Both red and black would now make their moves evolving around this issue and a battle of blockades and counter blockades is about to begin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red's intentions are very clear. She wants to prevent the black chariot from moving, and that is why she had chosen to play the horse twice.||If black were allowed to play R2+1, red would be on the receiving end of things.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]A must make move.||Black cannot play P5+1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red is forced to defend and give up her central cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Nice move!||This effectively stamped out red's momentum in attack, throwing a wrench in her plans.||P5+1 is another option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And black adopted a no nonsense approach in this situation.||After the exchange, the black chariot would be free from red's blockade.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And black is now better than red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]At this stage in the game, although red has one more elepahnt, her chess pieces are poorly positioned and dispersed. This would be a lethal weakness.||In comparison, black's chess pieces are not only well positioned, they are also well coordinated. The pawn on the 7th pawn is ready to go. It is very obvious as to who has the advantage now.||Black would go on to win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]Again, red would not be able to do much.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_28]And red would have a big problem on her hands, trying to find the best way of dealing with her cross river pawn. If it is captured, all the efforts that she had placed on the pawn would be gone.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]And black would be prepared to exchange material.||Red would be in a tough situation, for if she accepted the exchange, the blockade on black's right flank what she had pieced together would be gone. If not, red would be under the threat of attack by this horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]And red would be attacking vigorously.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]And red would have control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]And red would lose material[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]And black would now control all the important ranks and files. This would be equally bad for red in the long run.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]GM Zhang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_15]This way, red gets to keep her chariot on the rib file while the horse can now add more pressure to black's right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_5]GM Zhang's recommendations[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_7]In this way, black would be denied any chance of a counter attack, while at the same time applying much pressure on black's right flank. ||Black would have a hard time trying to ease the pressure on her right flank and thus red would be able to control the game better and more confidently.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_7]
