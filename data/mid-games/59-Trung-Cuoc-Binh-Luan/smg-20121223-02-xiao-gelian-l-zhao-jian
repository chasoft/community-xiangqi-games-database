[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121223 02 Xiao GeLian L Zhao Jian||||This was the midgame reached when HuNan's provinces Xiao GeLian took on JiangSu's Zhao Jian.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]By making this move, black's applies a pin on red's left chariot indirectly as the cannon is now aiming at the elephant.||However, making this move would also allow red exchange pawns with P3+1. There are pros and cons to this move.||However, in my opinion, R9=4 might have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Advancing the horse now would seem inappropriate as red's right flank would now be relatively empty  and prone to attack. Besides, where this horse would go or where it should attack would still be an issue to be resolved.||Red should have played P3+1 to add pressure on black's 7th filed horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Proactive move to attack the pawn rank![/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red's previous R8+8 move was an intermediate move, hoping to disrupt black's formation so that he could play R8-4 on the next move to attack the pawn.||This way, red would be able to C2+1 to attack the black chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]This was what red had planned since moving R8+8 two moves ago.||By making this move, red tries to make more room for himself to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Correct move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]A very aggressive move!||Black could also have chosen to play R1=8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This would seem like an obvious move to make, but in reality, red has just missed out on a chance to attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]This is the move that lost the game for red.||Retreating the advisor to capture the cannon would  be an invitation for the black pawn to charge into the palace!||P5+1 would have been better.||Although black would still have the advantage, the game would still be very complex as both sides have equivalent material.||Red would still have his chances in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Black's cannon is now in total control of the central file while this pawn has now officially charged into the palace.||Red's prospects look very bleak now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This is the only way where red can resolve the impending checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]And black makes a very nice move with this offer![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]And red resigned.||Jim: For beginners, red can only move K5=4, whereby black would checkmate with R1=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]GM Zhang's recommendation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]And red would have concentrated his chariots and cannon on this side of the board. Red would have a strong attack going on![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]And black would be faster in the kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]And black would have a huge advantage as red lacked an elephant to help defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]No advisable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]And black would have a seething attack waiting to happen. Red would be in deep trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_16]Jim: These were the moves that I had added after contemplating the GM's comments. Say red chose to take the cannon...or the pawn with the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]Jim: Black would be all over the place.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]And black would not be far away from victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]And black's attack would be very fearsome.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_8]Why this should not be done![/DhtmlXQ_comment7_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]And black would have the obvious advantage and be prepared to gain material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
