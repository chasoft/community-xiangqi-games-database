[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121223 03 Li ZhiPing L Miao YongPeng||||This was the midgame reached when Tianjin's Master Li ZhiPing took on ShenYang's GM Miao YongPeng.   ??3,??????????????????[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Black retreats the cannon to allow his right chariot to move to this side of the board.||Very ingenious plan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]After preventing red from developing his chariot with R1=2, black plays this move. ||Very good order of moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And red sees that his horse would not have much chance of development and decides to develop it on the other side instead. ||Very lively play from red too![/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And the black chariots part ways again.||Black shows his prowess in this neat order of moves played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Moving the cannon to the side would not seem to be that emergent.||R4+3 to control the important riverbank would have been better. Red could then see what black was up to and counter more precisely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And although red needed to advance his chariot, he should still have consdered playing R4+3 instead.||That way, he could also develop his right chariot with R1+1. The effects of such a play would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Red would not play R4=3. That is why this cannon move was uncalled for. R4+3 would have been better as black would be faster.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And this move shows that red had been planning it for some time now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]A must make move.||Black has spent so many moves to prevent red from developing this chariot. That is why black would need to make this move to prevent the chariot from moving.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Red cannot be greedy and play R4=1 now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And black threatens to eliminate the biggest threat that red has now. Nice move!||Jim: Red is now in a dilemma. If he accepted the exchange, the black horse would be very threatening. And red's right chariot still has not left the garage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Jim: Black has literally sidelined the two red chariots, and greatly reduced the space that the two chariots could move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And black made use of this opportunity to charge his left horse into a rather empty enemy territory.||With these few horse moves, black's horse has prevented the red chariots from moving to the important ranks and files.||This had been black's plans all along.||Although black would have to give up his central pawn, give and take, it is clear that black felt that control of the game was worth the loss of the central pawn.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]This move does nothing much, and prevents his chariots from moving to better positions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]And black sacrifices his side pawn, tempting red's cannon to attack. Very good use of tactics![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Red must have felt that development of his cannon was not that big a deal at this point in time, and that is why he chose to take the pawn with his pawn instead.||But in reality, after this pawn exchange, black's chariot would not be threatened any more and would instead, also allow his side horse much room for development. That is why, P9+1 was not a wise move.||Following this line of reasoning, red should ahve played C9+4 instead.||That way, red could still move R+=5 and red's prospects in the game would still seem optimistic.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]Perhaps red was under time pressure, so the moves made by red were a little bit impractical.||Red's riverbank horse was well positioned and a legitimate threat to black. Using this horse in exchange for black's side horse was not a wise move as black's side horse would still have some way to go before it could exert its effect on the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]And after red's threat have been eliminated, black's outlook on the game is very optimistic now.||Black controls the important rib file and is prepared to launch his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Good move!||With this pawn exchange, black's horse would now be able to move to the center of the board where it could do much.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]Black's moves have been very precise. ||Now, black hits red right below the belt.||Jim: Pardon me for my translation, but I think it gets the point across very aptly...[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment54]Jim: for beginners, black would mate with H5+6 and this is the only way that red can resolve the threat, temporarily...[/DhtmlXQ_comment54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment61]And black is sure to win now.||The remaining moves have not been included.[/DhtmlXQ_comment61]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]And red could play R1+1. That way, red's prospects  would seem ok.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]NO NO NO!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]And red would be sure to lose at least one chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_21]
