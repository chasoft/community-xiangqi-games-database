[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121122 02 Lai HanShun L Lai JunYing ||||Jim: This is the second midgame that GM Zhang commented upon.||||This game was played by Singapore's Lai HanShun vs  Vietnam's Lai JunYing. At this stage of the game, red's cross riverbank chariot has the black chariot and rootless chariot pinned. Red's 7th file pawn is also about to charge across the river . All seems rosy for red, but black's moves to follow completely turned the game around to black's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]And black prepares to go for the elbow horse attack!||This is a key move![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]If red tried to gain material with C5=2, black would sacrifice material but gain a very powerful central cannon![/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And black chooses to sacrifice his horse. ||Moving the chariot to control this rib file is a good move because black has understood where red's weaknesses are.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red has falsely believed that with this move, he could still preven black's rib file chariot from moving (with R9+9). Unfortunately, this was exactly what black had been hoping for![/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And red makes another chariot sacrifice!||Red was caught completely unawares.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Red is forced to make this move out of desperation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Black wins the game.||In this midgame, black's train of thought was cohesive and read the game very accurately.||The moves leading up to the kill were very effective and target oriented. ||A good lesson to be learnt![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]And red would not be able to prevent black's R4=5 checkmate on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]And red would still have a hard time as black can play H6+7 followed by C8=6 for the kill!||Red would also be in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]If red had tried to gain material with C5=2, black could have responed in this manner. And after a few rounds, black's central cannon is too big a threat for red to handle. ||That is perhaps why red chose to play P7+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]
