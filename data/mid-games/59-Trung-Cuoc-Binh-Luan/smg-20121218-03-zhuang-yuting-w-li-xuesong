[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121218 03 Zhuang YuTing W Li XueSong||||Jim: This game was also very briefly commented by Master Huang ShaoLong. As there was not much comment, I have opted not to add them, except for the final few moves that he explained why black resigned.||This was the midgame reached when GuangDong's GM Zhuang YuTing took on HuBei's Master Li XueSong.||At this stage in the game, black had perceived that red's riverbank horse was a possible target of attack, and that was why he blatantly charged the central pawn forward.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And red firmly sacrificed his horse. This is because red had the entire game in sight.||If red had tried to protect the horse, black's two horses could still harass red's riverbank chariot and the red chariot would be at the mercy of the horses, and thus lose momentum in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]This is a continuation of red's sacrifice.||At this point, Black is already down 3 pawns. And red is now threatening to gain more material. This would make black's gain of material earlier look to have been a bad bargain. This would also adhere to the maxim: gaining material but losing tempo is not a good strategy![/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]In the previous move, black tries to sneak one cannon into red's pawn rank (C2+4), forcing red to block it.||After red's cannon had blocked the black cannon, black immediately moves the cannon back to the original position, while at the same time preparing to charge his side horse across the river.||Black has also spent much time to think up of such a ploy.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And although red has gained back lost material, his chariot and cannon are still pinned by black.||The issue for red now would be to free his himself from black's pin.||If he were successful, his pawn advantage would be marked and decisive in the game to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And black shows his resolve in the game with this move.||Advancing the pawn would allow the black's chariot to pain red's chariot and two cannons in the same rank, while limiting black's red horse at the same time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]But advancing the pawn now would be debatable.||Perhaps H1+2 would be better as it would help black gain tempo as red's pieces are still tied up at the moment.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And red does not back down from red's challenge and sacrificed his horse instead!||GM Zhuang was once nicknamed the king of the 10th round, and he shows his prowess in this game. ||Although black would be one horse up, red's pawns would be a major headache for black.||The major pieces are also well positioned for red and thus red would have the advantage in this game, despite being a horse down.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Black advanced his chariot to harass red's palace.||Red plays the side cannon in response, showing signs of acute sense of danger.||By making this move, red would allow his chariot to play R5=8 to defend against the onslaught of black's cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]In the previous few moves, black has tried desperately to organize 2r1c into something offensive but had been resolved by red each time.||Now, black's chess pieces are poorly positioned. ||It would be hard for black to even try for a draw now.||Black can now only wait for red's pawns to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And red starts his final attack with this no-nonsense move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Black resigned.||Jim: I have managed to find the following moves given by Master Huang ShaoLong explaining why black resigned.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Jim: These were the moves given by Master Huang ShaoLong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_49]Jim: I added this variation for the beginner to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_49]
