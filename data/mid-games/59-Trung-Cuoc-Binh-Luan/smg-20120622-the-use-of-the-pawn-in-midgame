[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120622 the use of the pawn in midgame||||In Xiangqi, the pawns are very weak in attack, but if put to good use, they still can be a lethal force to be reckoned with. There are many uses for the pawns, and once they cross the river, their value multiplies multifold. They can often be sacrificed, used to threaten opposing chess pieces, or simply set the game up for other chess pieces to exert their influence.||There is a saying in chinese, “ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ”which means that once the pawns cross the river, they are equivalent to chariots". ||In this example, red has the material upperhand but black has that black side pawn that has crossed the river, and has mounted an attack on an empty left red flank. Let us watch how black uses this humble pawn to win the game!||Black first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Black has moved the pawn four consecutive times and each time it moves, it poses a greater and greater threat as it nears the palace.||And now, the red cannon is caught.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red tries to be proactive but his palace is under heavy attack.||Perhaps a better move would be R2=4 to defend and attack at the same time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Great move! This would force black to raise the advisor and open the way for attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Black refuses to sacrifice the old pawn as it is still very functionable![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And black prepars for the checkmate with this move! The function of the black pawn is evident now!||Black's horse can defend with H3-4 should red try to attack with the elbow horse H8+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And after the red chariot is captured, black is sure of a win with overwhelming material advantage...all this made possible with the use of the pawn![/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
