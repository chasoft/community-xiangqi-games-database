[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120919 What would you do if you were GM Yang part 3c||||In Sept 1977, the Chinese National Singles Xiangqi preliminaries were held.||GM Yang Guanlin took red and started the game with the elephant opening. His opponent was  Shi Juemin ??? from Inner Mongolia, who countered Yang's elephant opening with the Left Central Cannon Counter.||A simple analysis of the game shows that all the major pieces are intact and red is only one pawn down. Red's left chariot and cannon have already been pushed deep into enemy territory and the two horses on the riverbank are threatening.||We start at move 17, GM Yang's turn... ||What would you do if you were GM Yang?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]By sacrificing the cannon, GM Yang tempts black's chariot to leave its current position, thereby allowing his horses to attack.||The depth and precision of his calculations are astounding! ||This move can be thought as a flying dagger, piercing black's heart..[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Click on the variations to see what might have happened if black refused the exchange...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]The previous cannon sacrifice was to set his horse up for this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]E3+5 would also be impossible![/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Another consecutive sacrifice!||Vicious![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Another sacrifice!!!||Red sacrifices three major pieces! ||GM Yang knows after analysis, that his remaining forces on the board are more than enough for a blistering kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]In his haste, black played this move, thus losing his chariot.||R4-2 would have prevented the loss of this chariot and would enable black to hold on a little bit longer![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Red wins.||In this example, GM Yang (red) his chess pieces in superior positions, all poised to attack. However, black still has a stubborn defence.||GM Yang starts with a cannon sacrifice to break open black's defense. He then tempts the black chariots away from defensive positions to start his vicious attack, and after a few more sacrifices, he manages to get the win![/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]And red would be in total control of the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_3]And black would also be in trouble![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]And red would also be in full control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]
