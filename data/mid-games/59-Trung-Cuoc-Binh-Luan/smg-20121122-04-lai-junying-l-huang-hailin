[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121122 04 Lai JunYing L Huang Hailin ||||This was the midgame that was arrived when Vietnam's Lai JunYing squared off against China's Huang HaiLin[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Vietnam's Lai had started the game with the rapid advancement of the central pawn variation of the central cannon. His intentions were clear.||In the past, this P7+1 had been frowned upon as black could answer with H7+5 (to take red's central horse) and then play R3+4 to capture this.  The presence of the black chariot at the riverbank would create much trouble for red. That was why for a long period of time, H5-7 was played instead.||In this crucial game, red decided to go with an old variation. Was it because that he had found something new?||Let us watch as the game progressed...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]This was slight change in the moves made, creating room for red's left chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And black decides to retreat his chariot first before attacking!||This is perhaps the most important move in this game.||With this retreat, black keeps his options open as he could still play C7=9 and also defend against red's checkmate threat of (C5+1 followed by K5=4 for the iron-bolt checkmate).[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]By giving up control of the rib files, red has acutally given up pinning the bottom ranked black chariot as it would be free to attack now.||The only move that red could play would be R9+2 , hoping to play R9=8 to join in the attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And once this pawn is allowed to advance so far, red is in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]As red's outlook was bleak, he decides to give it one last shot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]And black wins!||Jim: I have added a few more moves to explain to the beginnner why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]And black would run out of attacking options.||Jim: Please compare this variation with the moves that were played in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]
