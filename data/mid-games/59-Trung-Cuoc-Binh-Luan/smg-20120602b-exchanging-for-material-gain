[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120602b Exchanging for material gain||||One of the most commonly used tactics in actual play is to gain an advantage in material and then slowly inch your way forward till a win is eminent. ||Exchanging for material gain is perhaps the most commonly tactic used. ||After all, in a fight or battle, the side with numerical superiority is more likely to win. ||Exchanging for material gain is a tactic whereby one players initiates an exchange whereby a few moves later, he would be able to achieve material gain. One important thing to note is that positional advantage must not be sacrificed or the gain in material might not be worth it! The side initiating the exchange must be better off after the exchange or else it would be better to try something else. In fact, your situation must be better for the exchange to be worth the trouble. ||In this game, red has concentrated his forces on his left flank. Black's chariots, horse and cannon are limited.||On red's right flank, the chariot on the rib file (which the WXF calls the armpit file) is sufficient to defend against any possible black counter-attack. Red has the obvious upperhand in this one.||Black's turn. How can black come from behind?||By exchanging for material gain. This was an actual game played and black would eventually gain  control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Black forces an exchange to prepare for his counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Red is forced to move his king to a precarious position. If black tried any other move, red would gain material with a discovered check with C4-5 and red not only lose the horse and also his threat to black's right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Brilliant!!!||Black targets the pesky red riverbank horse and 'unlinks' the red horses with this elephant sacrifice. The black cannon is now skewering red's chariot and cannon also with this move. There goes red's attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And black is sure to gain at least one more horse.||The black chariot would be too tough for red too handle. Black's game for the taking![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And black would capture the horse, gaining material. Although the red chariot and cannon look menacing, in actual fact, red can not do much with them.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]And black would be still on the winning end, threatening with a horse cannon checkmate.||The red chariot would be lost any time now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
