[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130220 03 Chi XinDe L Zeng QiQuan||||This was the situation reached when Chi XinDe took  on Zeng QiQuan after 10 moves. Black had chosen to play E3+5 to prevent playing the usual variations.||If black had chosen to play P7+1 it would have been one of the common variations to play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Moving the horse to the center is in line with red's strategy of attacking the center and advancing the central pawn a few moves earlier.||It is a feasible tactic.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]And black snuffs out red's central pawn which was an immediate threat, while at the same time preparing to launch a counter. This was black's game plan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And the fight along the central file is stopped temporarily.||Black starts his counterattack along the 7th file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And red does not bother about black's attack on his 3rd file (black's 7th file). Instead, he chooses to attack the advisor, which is made possible by his central pawn.||This move would also prevent black from harassing the central cannon with R8+4.||This is very tight play from red.||Jim: Red would be prepared to fork black's charios with C4+7.||And for beginners, playing this move would discourage black from R8+4 as if black does indeed do so, red could counter with C4+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black used his chariot to exchange for cannon and the horse. It is a must make move as black decided to relieve the pressure applied by red's central cannon and is a continuation of R8+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This is not a bad choice for red, as it would allow red to capture the black's cross river pawn on the next move.||R4=7 is another viable option. o[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]During the past few rounds, the tempo and speed of black's retaliation has not been fast enought, thereby allowing red to increase his advantage in the game.||Black was also forced to use his chariot to exchange for red's cannon and horse.||At this point in time, the slight advantage should be awarded to red. Red would also have the one pawn advantage over black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black thought long and hard before making this move.||After using his chariot in exchange for red's horse and cannon, the only thing that was in black's favor was that his chess pieces were better developed than red. ||Playing this move would disallow red from playing H8+7, thereby developing his horse properly. That way, black could buy time to adjust his chess pieces, at the expense of his horse being forced to the side.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Inefficient move!||Red's left horse and chariot is already hampered in development. Playing the advisor now would make things worse.||H8+9 would have been better as it would allow red to develop his left flank rapidly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]And black pounces on the chance given by red.||With this pawn exchange, he gains much room to move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]Good move!||This would threaten red's left chariot with C2=1, while at the same time, allow black to move the cannon to the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Jim: black is now threatening to checkmate with C7+8, that is why the elephant has to be moved.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]And black shows his determination to attack with another chariot exchange.||After the exchange, black's two horses and cannons are ready to launch a do or die attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And black has caused much trouble for red, attacking all over the place. Red has been hurrying all over the place trying to defend against black's onslaught.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]Jim: Finally, red's remaining chariot gets to move, but it would seem to be too late.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment48]Jim: Wow, another sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment48]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And red finally throws in the towel as his lone chariot is unable to hold off black's attack.||Jim: Red's chariot cannot take the black horse, or it would be captured by black's check with H5+3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_15]And red would still have the pawn advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_5]And black's attack along the 7th file would have been obstructed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_5]
