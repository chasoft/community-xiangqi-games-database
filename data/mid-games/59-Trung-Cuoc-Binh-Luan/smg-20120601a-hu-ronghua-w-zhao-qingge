[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120601a Hu Ronghua W Zhao Qingge ||||This game was played way back in July 1979 in a competition whereby competitors from 4 different provinces and cities were invited.||||The opening was Hu's Angel's Pawn vs Zhao's elephant opening. ||An initial look at the board shows that both players have guarded the river and neither has been able to get any of their troops across the river. It would seem to be a drawish game...||After some thought, GM Hu takes note of a small opening in Black's riverbank and sacrifices his central pawn for the win. ||His brilliance is shown in this game...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]By sacrificing the central pawn to capture the chariot, red opens up a hold in black's tight rivernbank defence. ||Hu's unparalleled Xiangqi brilliance is seen here![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]C2+1 is inadvisable...[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]The red horse is poisoned. Click on the variation below to understand why black cannot take it![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And within a span of 7 moves, red has maneuvered his major pieces to black's empty right flank.||Red makes black's situation more grim with this horse sacrifice. There is nothing stopping red now![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Another brilliant move! Red threatens with a checkmate H7+5 after this discovered attack. prepares to go for the kill with H9+7. Black resigned here.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And red gains back the lost material, together with a huge lead in the game. Victory would not be far away now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]Red could also choose to play R7+2. Red prepares to move C8=5 to attack the trapped chariot with this move.||Either way, red would have a significant advantage now![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]
