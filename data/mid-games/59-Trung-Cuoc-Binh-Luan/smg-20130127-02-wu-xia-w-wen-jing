[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130127 02 Wu Xia W Wen Jing||Jim: this was the second board discussed. ||||This was the game played by JiangSu's Wu Xia when she took on GuangDong's Wen Jing.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1] A proactive approach from Wu Xia.||C8+2 is also a possibility as red could prepare to play P3+1 on the next move to create space for movement.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]And black does not back down and returns a central cannon instead.||However, such a move would cause black's formation to be less balance. ||H2+3 might be a better option. Black could move the elephants and advisors then for a solid defense. The prospects would look good.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]If black played H2+3, red would play C9=8 and prepare to form a blockade.||That is why black decided to change her entire formation instead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]The riverbank horse was occupying a very important position on the board, and should have moved only at the best possible time.||But red charges the horse forward which is a little bit wasted.||Just from counting the number of effective moves played, red had moved the horse 3 times in exchange for a pawn that has never move at all. Such an exchange should not have occurred.||R9=8 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]It can be seen that after the exchange, red's central cannon is not a big threat to black. Instead, red's horse on the third file would become a weak point, waiting for black to exploit.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Red was too optimistic of her analysis of the board, and forgot the weakness of her horse.||R8+5 would have been better, as it would allow red to protect the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Good move! Black targeted the red horse and starts to mount a counter.||In this way, when red's horse retreats away from the third file, red's center would become fragile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Perhaps black has seen the weakness in red's central file and rushed to attack with this move.||This move would seem to have been made in haste.||Black could have played R4+2 to disturb red's horse..[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Another nonchalant move from red.||C7+7 for the check would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]The black chariot has adanced and retreated to the same intersection, thereby allowing red to increase her tempo.||The game would go against black now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]Correct move.||If red thought that she could capture the black chariot and chose to play H5+6 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Black's cannon has attacked without much thought, leaving her formation in a disarray, which would prove to be lethal later.||K4=5 would have been better to avoid red's attack,  as even though red would still be better, but it would take much effort for red to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Black was under time pressure and had to make some moves or she would lose.||However, the past two moves are " a check followed by an chase" (Jim: the rules in China a little bit different that the AXF rules. ).||Under the Chinese rules, black must change her moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]As red's horse has been a huge threat, black can only eliminate with her cannon, unwillingly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment47]Red has already a mighty central pawn and her pawn on the 7th file is now prepared to cross the river. Red's advantage in the game has just increased in a big way.[/DhtmlXQ_comment47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]A tight move, oppressing the movement of the black horse, thereby disallowing black any possibility of a counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]And at this stage in the game, red is clearly the aggressor. Red would win later.[/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]And red's plans of capturing the chariot would be thwarted and the game would be thrown into confusion again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]And black would have an attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]Red could only counter with this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]And suddenly red's prospects would seem bleak.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_7]And there are many weaknesses in black's current formation waiting to be exploited. Red would have the obvious advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_7]
