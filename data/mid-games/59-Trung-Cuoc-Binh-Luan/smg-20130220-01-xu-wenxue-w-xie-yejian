[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130220 01 Xu WenXue W Xie YeJian ||||In this game, ChongQing's Xu WenXue took on HuNan's Xie YeJian.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This is a relatively rare variation. In the past R6+2 was played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]A timely move to make. ||Black has shown his intentions to attack red's left horse. Traversing the cannon to the center now would allow red to protect the central cannon from black's C5+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And black speeds up his counter. ||However, he has underestimated the danger that his centroid horse would bring. ||C5+3 would be a possible alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Red tries to develop his left chariot in response to black's play.||Black counters with a cannon blockade, showing his aggressions. However, this cannon move does not do much.||C2=4 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And red shows his aggressive intentions with this horse sacrifice.||By moving the chariot to black's throat rank and (blocking the elephant) at the same time, red has targeted red's centroid horse weakness and has conceived an attack based on this red weakness.||A very aggressive move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And black takes the sacrifice unwillingly.||If he did not make this move, he would be behind in both material and position.||That is why he chose to gain material first before trying to counter red's attack precisely.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And red starts his attack by attacking from the edge file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]An experienced move to play. Red does not forget to defend appropriately when attacking.||This would also prevent black from moving his chariot to his left flank to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Black is forced to make this move.??[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And red has managed to gain back lost material and while at the same time extended his lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Red does not give black any chance of a breather and attacks relentlessly.||Red has shown much versatility and precision in his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]Red won as black resigned.||Jim: I have added a few more moves to show the beginner why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Double checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_50]And red would not be far from a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]And red would be sure to win now with the material advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]And red would be prepared to play R2=7 to gain material. He would also not be far from a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]And red would not only gain back lost material, but also control the tempo of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]And red's attack would run out of steam.||Black would be prepared to counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_8]And it would be a fierce attacking game for both sides.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_9]And black would still a playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_7]And black would still have a playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_3]And the battle would quickly progress into a complicated and vicious fist-fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_3]
