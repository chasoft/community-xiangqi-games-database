[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130407 03 Zhao GuoRong L Shen Peng ||??? ?? ??||||In the 20th round, HeiLongJiang's Zhao GuoRong took on HeBei's Shen Peng and this was the midgame arrived.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Black had played H2+3 a few moves earlier and this was a continuation of his strategy to attack red's third file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]An aggressive move from red, attempting to increasing his initiative in the game.||However, it is also a risky move.||C8+2 would be able to protect red's right flank but it would seem to be too compromised and passive for red.||C3-3 would give black the lead in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE!!!||And this would be the start of black's road to victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]A must make move for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]A sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Black does not play R7+1 and instead chooses to attack with H3+4. This is to hasten the development of the black chess pieces.||However, black's attacking potential would not be as strong as previously perceived.||R7+1 would have been more practical.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]This move was made to allow black to retain the possibility of C2+7 for a sneak attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]This was to relieve black's pin on the red cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And black shows that he has not let his guard down with this move!||At this point in time, it would be impossible for black to launch a powerful enough attack.||The next best thing for black would be to try to maximize the potential of his 2r1c1p combination and try to limit the potential of red's remaining material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And this move shows red's aggressive intentions.||A subjective analysis would show that this would be an approximately equal situation for both sides and there are immediate areas of concern to address. However, perhaps of the fact that this was a game of rapid chess, red decided to make use of his material advantage to try to make the best of things.||But because of the fact that red was greedy for a win, black is bestowed a chance for a counter offensive![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]A rather nonchalant move.||R8+7 would have been a much wicked move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]And black loses the game.||R7-4 would still save the day for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]Good move!||Red had not expected this move and things have just gotten from bad to worse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]And black enters the endgame with material advantage.||The rest of the moves have been omitted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]And red would still be still safe.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]And according to the rules, it would be a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]And things would look drawish.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]And black would not be able to crack red's fortified defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_19]And although black would be lacking one horse comparatively, black has made up for that with better positioning and the cross river pawn. Red's horses would still need some development, especially the left horse, which is under heavy attack.||Black would still be attacking.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]And black would still have a very playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_7]And the combination left on the board for red would be poorer than black. Black would also have better positioning.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_5]And black would have the lead in th game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_5]
