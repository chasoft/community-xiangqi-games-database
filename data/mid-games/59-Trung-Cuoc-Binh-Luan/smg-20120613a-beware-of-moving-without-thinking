[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120613a beware of moving without thinking||||Many times in the course of a game, we often make moves out of habit or instinct without really thinking. ||These eventual mistakes are often deadly and costly and should be avoided at all costs. This is also a lesson that beginners need to learn. ||As seen in this example, red has a heavy attack going on and a kill would seem not far away. However, black is delivering a check now. ||Perhaps red has lowered his guard and plays A6+5... leading to drastic consequences...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]H4-5 would have been better!||Moving the advisor might seem the thing to do, but black would be able to turn the tables![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]After making this move, black gains the time and space required for a breather and to organize his moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Correct ![/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]And black mounts his counter attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red's turn to defend. ||In just a span of 10 moves, red is on the receiving end of black's attack. Red tries to go for a draw now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Black has moved very well in the previous few moves.||Red's king is in a precarious position and the red chariot and horse are unable to return to defend in time. Black cleverly destroys red's defenses with the last few moves while still maintaining a lead in the attack.||Red is done for now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]And red would be unable to resolve black's H7+8 checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_15]Red wins after capturing the chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_7]P3=4 is not advisable now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]And red is sure to lose material now.||Black has successfully overturned the tables.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]And black would be faster in the attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_3]And the speed of red's attack would be faster than black's. A win would still be red's grasp.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_3]
