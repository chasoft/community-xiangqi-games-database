[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120919 What would you do if you were GM Yang part 3b mm xqtjdszjfd ydlht 0108||||This game was played back in January 1977. An international friendly was held for players from China, Philippines, Malaysia and Hong Kong. ||Representing China was GM Yang Guanlin who went up against Philippines Cai Wengou???. The opening was the Angel's Pawn vs Horse counter.||||A brief analysis of the game shos that material wise, both sides are about equal. But red has a menacing central pawn and the chariot and horses are poised to attack.||We start at move 22, GM Yang's turn: ||What would you do if you were GM Yang Guanlin?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]GM Yang starts his attack with this blithering sacrifice.||Very aggressive move![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Jim: One horse in exchange for an elephant and an advisor, well worth it!||This sets the game up for the might horse and cannon combination![/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Jim: This is a textbook example of how to maneuver your horse with the aid of the cannon. Brilliant!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]GM Yang continues his attack by retreating his horse for the check. The magnificent steed does all in this game! ||With the threat of a discovered check, the horse gallops to victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Jim: Preparing for H7-6 for a discovered check to try to capture the chariot...[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Jim: after moving the horse 9 out of the past 15 moves, red has finally maneuvered his horse to the position that he wants.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Checkmate.||||In this game, GM Yang Guanlin shows aggression with a horse sacrifice to push the central pawn forward for the kill. He then shows a textbook example of maneuvering the horse with the aid of the cannon �????�for a brilliant kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]The central pawn is poisoned...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]And black is bound to lose the chariot.||Red would cruise to victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]
