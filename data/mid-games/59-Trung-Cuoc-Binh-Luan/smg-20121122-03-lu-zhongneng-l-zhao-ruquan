[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121122 03 Lu ZhongNeng L Zhao RuQuan||||In this example, Australia's Lu ZhongNeng took red against Hong Kong's Zhao RuQuan.||At this stage in the game, although red's horses on the riverbank look menacing, the other red pieces are poorly developed and the formation is not balanced.||How will black attack then?||||Jim: Australia's Xq king vs Hong Kong's Xq king!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]With this move, black gets to strengthen his center and also allow his other chariot to play R1=4 to attack red's horse. An effective move with many purposes![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]This is the first step in black's attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]R3+2 is not feasible for black now![/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]The positioning of the red pieces were poor. That is why black decided to use on chariot in exchange for red's horse and cannon, while at the same time cotnrolling red's cannon rank.||But it must be mentioned that the moves that black continued with were excellent. If red were allowed the chance to readjust his formation, red would be better off as two chariots are simply much stronger than one![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And black extends his lead in this game by threatening to capture the elephant and thus controlling this file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Black's R4=3 on the previous move pays dividends now. Not only has it pinned red's cannon and chariot, it has also allowed this cannon to attack red's pawn rank. This futher limits the space that red's cannon and chariot can move. ||This two moves are perhaps the most important moves in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]And red's answer is not proactive enough.||Perhaps R1=2 to attack black's horse would have been better for a counter blockade.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Playing this move is a little bit too early, and red could have pounced on the horse.||Perhaps R3-1 would be a better move to control red's pawn rank. It would be a much more powerful move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Playing this move would actually help black!||Red should have made use of this chance to play R9=6 to attack the black horse. ||If red would play R9=6, there would not be many good places for the black horse to move and it could have turned the tide back to red's favor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Very versatile move!||Black retreated his horse temporarily to prepare for the palcorner horse attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]This seemed to have been an instinctive play by black. C2-2 might have been the road to an easier win![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Playing the advisor now would actually help black out as the black cannon would actually become a threat.||R9=8 for an exchange of cannons would ahve been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]Ingenious way of creating space for the black horse to move![/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]And once this horse is allowed into the game, red would have trouble trying to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment45]The two horses do a tango on the riverbanks, causing much trouble for red![/DhtmlXQ_comment45]
[DhtmlXQ_comment57]Black wins![/DhtmlXQ_comment57]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]And black would gain back lost material. ||The game would proceed into endgame basically with red's 2r vs black's 1r1h1c. Black's 1r1h1c combination would be better than and red would have a hard time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]Jim: Just in case you were wondering if this was possible...I added this variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]And black would not gain much...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]No no no!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]And black would actually be at red's mercy!||Jim: For beginners, red threatens to checkmate with E1+3 now...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_9]The only way to resolve this threat.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_10]And red would gain back lost material in addition to the elephant and disrupting black's defense![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_10]
