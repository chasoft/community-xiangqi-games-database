[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130407 01 Wang YueFei L Fan SiYuan||??? ?? ???||Jim: This was a column in the periodical XiangQi on midgame which was maintained by GM Zhang GuoFeng.||||This was a game played in the last round of the A League in 2005. Taking red was SiChuan's Wang YueFei while his opponent was HuNan's Fan SiYuan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Black had shown his intentions of attacking red's seventh file forward. Red responds by edging the cannon to develop his left chariot in the attempt for increased iniative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]This move was made to force red to show how he would respond to black's threat.||It would seem to to be very aggressive, but it would block black's chariot and allow red a chance to seize the initiative in the game.||Perhaps C2=4 would be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]The red horse has occupied a very important position on the board now. Perhaps black's best option now would be to exchange chariots.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]In the preceding moves, red shows much clarity in his strategy.||By edging the cannon now to reveal develop his chariot, red prepares to move R2+6 followed by H4+3.||After H4+3, red would continue with C1+4 to attack black's empty left flank.||Black would have a hard time.have many options attacking black's left flank with H4+3,[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]After much consideration, black decided against defending and chose to launch a counter of his own.||R2+3 would allow red to have a huge pawn advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Playing R2+5 would force black to attack the elephant. C1+4 would allow black a chance to fortify his defences.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]If black insisted on E3+5, red would answer with R1=6 and red would have both the material and positional advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Red had a huge advantage thus far, and got careless. This move by the horse was uncalled for and allowed black into thegame.||H-+4 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]This would allow black to maintain his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment42]After fortifying his defense with this move, black would not have any more worries and can concentrate solely on attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment42]
[DhtmlXQ_comment50]Brilliant move!||Black is sure to gain material now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment51]H4+6 would not be better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment51]
[DhtmlXQ_comment52]And black has secured sufficient advantage to ensure a win.||The rest of the moves have been omitted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_54]And red would also be in deep trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_54]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_43]And red's 1r1h1p combination would still be a threat that must be addressed.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]And red would not be far away from a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]Red would seem to be faster in the exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]And black would be denied a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]And black would have a winning position and also material advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]And black would have succeeded in increasing his defences. Black would now be able to take his time to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]Red would have the significant pawn advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_11]And red would have the obvious advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_9]And red would have the spatial advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_9]And red would still have the obvious spatial advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_8]And red's horse is forced deep into enemy territory where it is very vulnerable to attack.||Jim: If it plays H4-2, red would have clogged his right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_8]
