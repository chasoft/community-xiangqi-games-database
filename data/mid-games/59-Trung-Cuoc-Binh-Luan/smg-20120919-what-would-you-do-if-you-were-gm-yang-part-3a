[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120919 What would you do if you were GM Yang part 3 ||||This was played way back in June 1976 in the Chinese National Xiangqi preliminaries.||Guangdong's Yang faced Beijing's famed Wang Guodong ???.||Yang had started with the central cannon with 7th filed horse variation while Wang had countered with the Screen Horse Defense with Double cross river cannons variation.||An initial analysis shows that ALL the major pieces are still on the board and the game was essentially a deadlock.||Red's (Yang) turn: ||What would you do if you were GM Yang Guanlin?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Out of nowhere the GM sacrifices his chariot!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red tempts black with another chariot sacrifice!||If black accepts, red would simply checkmate with C1+3. ||If not, red would have the pawn advantage and most  probably be able to gain more material with the chariot cannon combination.||Red is basically assured of victory now.||The rest of the moves have been omitted.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]Black cannot take the chariot![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]!!! Another sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]And red threatens to checkmate with H4+6/H4+3 at the same time.||Black would not be able to resolve both checkmates  at the same time. Red wins.||Jim: I have added extra moves to show the beginner why this is a checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_5]And red would still checkmate in the same manner![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_5]
