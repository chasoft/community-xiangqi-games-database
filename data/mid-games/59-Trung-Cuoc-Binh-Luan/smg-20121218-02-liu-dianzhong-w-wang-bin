[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121218 02 Liu DianZhong W Wang Bin ||||Jim: I found two commentaries regarding this game, one by GM Zhang GuoFeng, and the other by GM Liu's disciple, International Master Yan WenQing. Master Yan had jokingly called GM Liu "The principle of the school of the 57 Cannons". lol.||||GM Zhang: This battle took place in round 11. HeBei Province's famed GM Liu DianZhong took on young GM  Wang Bin from JiangSu Proivince. It was a lightning chess game.||Both were experts with the 57 Cannons and both had started the game with openings that they had been very familiar with.||In the previous move, GM Liu had played R2=4 which was a new move.||Let us see how the two GMs go at it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Zhang: H8+7 is another option which would be lead to a less violent game.||Yan: If black wanted to be more stoic, he could have chosen to play H8+7 to add pressure on red's central cannon. ||R8+1 would also be another possibility as it would allow black to add substance his weak right flank.||However, it was red who had been "irrational" with R2=4 first, so how could the young GM stomach this? That was why the young GM decided to accept the challenge and played C8=7. And from this move onward, a ferocious battle would begin.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Zhang: And red does not care about black's possible P7+1.||Instead, red chose to advance his own P7+1 to attack black's right flank. ||This is the essence of red's new R2=4 variation.||GM Liu's viciousness on the board is shown thoroughly.||Yan: A new move! Despite black's impending P7+1 attack, red does not care about it and goes about the game as planned. This is a very fierce move, attempting to attack black's right flank.||A bloody battle with each player attacking one side would now ensue.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Zhang: Correct choice to make.  ||Yan: And red showed much resolve and confidence in his moves, forcing black to slow down his attack.||After thinking for a long time, black decides to play C++2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Zhang: Playing C++3 would not be advisable.||But perhaps another alternative would be to play H8+6 as it would give black more flexibility in terms of attack and defense. Black would still have a game going on. ||Yan: Weak move! Black sholuld have played H8+6 as it would allow him to both attack and defend at the same time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Zhang: And the elderly GM draws first blood! ||Yan: By attacking the central pawn, red is keen on  gaining control of the game. This is the correct choice to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Zhang: And red does not forget to defend while he attacked. After this side elephant move, his formation would not be at the mercy of the black cannons.||Yan: After this side elephant move, black's target of attack is now removed, and black's attack would be greatly stalled. Black would now be forced to defend as he has no efficient attack temporarily. This is the marked of experienced play from red.||In the game that follows, black would be at the mercy of red's many attacking possibilities.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Zhang: This move was perhaps made out of instinct.||Black would still have a chance in the game should he have played H8+6 as it would be a much faster move. ||Yan: And black advances his side pawn in the hope of preventing red from attacking with C5=9. Under most circumstancs, this 'leisurely' move from red would not be very effective. ||Being aggressive with H8+6 now would perhaps still offer black a chance in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Zhang: If black played K6-1, red would move C5=6 and black would still have a hard time in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Zhang: Black had intended to slow red's attack with this move.||However, K6-1 might have been slightly better, although red would immediately counter with C5=6.||||Yan: And after black had played a weak move, red had pounced on the chance and used it to maneuver his cannons for the final kill.||To be fair, both players were now under time pressure and black had made this move under such circumstances.||However, this chariot move not only does nothing much, it reveals more weaknesses in black's defense.||At this stage, black should have played K6-1 to prevent red from using the discovered check. ||Of course, red would continue with C5=6 and black would still still be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]Zhang: And red stuns black with this sacrifice!!!||Good move!||Age has not caught up with GM Liu and his attack is still as vicious as ever. His thinking is very clear and sound. ||Yan: And black's defense is shattered with this move. The moves that follow show that black can only be on the receiving end of things now. ||||Jim: For beginners, red is threatening to gain material with the discovered check.||Black cannot play A4+5 or red would simply play R7-1 to capture the black chariot and the game would be over.[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Zhang: And black tries to be aggressive in the final stages of this fight.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Yan: As black's future looked dim, he decides to be aggressive with this move, hoping that he would be lucky enough. This was also done out of desperation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment30]Zhang: And GM Liu shows why he has been one of the most feared players in China for the past few decades.||Moving the chariot to the armpit file would allow red to capture material with the discovered check.||At the same time it would allow red to defend.||Red cannot play R7+1 or black would win instead!||Yan: Yan: One must never be careless despite playing a winning game!||Red's chariot on the rib file allows him to both attack and defend brilliantly at the same time. It shows that he had read the game accurately.[/DhtmlXQ_comment30]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]Yan: And black is forced to advance his horse out of desperation. If he did not, red could threaten to capture the black chariot with R6+2 (Jim: followed by the discovered check).[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment32]Zhang: Red cannot play R6+1 now or he would still lose the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment32]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]Zhang: And at this point in the game, red has gained material while defended very well.||Red is sure to win now!||Yan: And red has basically secured victory after this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]Zhang: Red won.||Yan: Red won. Victory and defeat are but temporary. The more important thing is that both masters of the 57 cannons have showed us a brilliant game with much ferocity in this one![/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]Zhang: And black would have overturned the tables on red![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]Zhang and Yan: And black would be faster in the kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]Yan: And although red would still be leading the game, black would still have his chances with his attack. At this point, black would still have many options of using various different tactics.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]Zhang: And black would be on the attack instead.||That would be something that GM Liu could swallow, and it would defeat the purpose of his earlier moves and plans.||Yan: And black would be the one who had sacrificed  to attack instead. This would defeat red's plans in the first place.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_12]Yan: And the moves that follow would be very complex. But instinctively, red would have the easier time as he would have more material and more space to maneuver.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]Zhang: And in the ensuing battle, red would still be faster than black in the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]Yan: And black would have a vicious attack going on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_14]Zhang: And red would have the advantage.||Yan: Red would be better!||Jim: That is because red would be faster in the kill to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_14]
