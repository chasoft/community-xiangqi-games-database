[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130220 02 Xie YeJian W Zheng YiHong||||This was the situation game that was played after 13 rounds when HuNan's Xie YeiJian took on XiaMen's GM Zheng YiHong.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]In the previous move, black had played C5-1 to prepare to move C5=3 to attack red's 7th file.||Red did not back down but instead advanced his pawn on the 7th file to try to open this file. ||A bold move!||However, this would seem to be rash as black had already been prepared to attack this file. Red could pay a dear price.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red had offered an elephant to try to gain tempo, whereby black accepted heartily.||After a few rounds of play, black has have gained material. ||However, making this move now would seem controversial. ||Black had planned to try to simplify the game as he now had the material advantage by exchanging material. However, althought the strategy was right, the moves played were less than desirable.||Red was thus given a chance to gain tempo and momentum in the attack.||H2+3 might have been better as black would be able to see how red would respond and target his attack with more precision.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]A rash choice!||Although red's empty left flank was very enticing,  red would still have many moves that could harass black and cause damage.||E3+5 to defend would have been better!  That way, black would not only have defended, the advantage he had with the extra elephant would become a major factor in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]After much harassment, black's defense finally cracked.||This was not a good move.||Black should have played E3-5. Although he would be inconvenienced for the time being, he would still have a playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Good move! ||Xie was known as the "Eccentric Blade from HuNan". He shows his skills and prowess in the tactics chosen in this game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]After black's mistake earlier on, red has followed  up with a merciless attack.||With this central cannon, red's attack is unstoppable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment31]This is a commonly used tactic. By moving the advisor to the palace corner, black's attack is undermined.[/DhtmlXQ_comment31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment43]Good move! Red shows great versatility by retreating the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment43]
[DhtmlXQ_comment56]And black is forced to give the horse up.[/DhtmlXQ_comment56]
[DhtmlXQ_comment69]And red denies black any chance of a breather, attacking in waves. Black is on the brink of collapse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment73]Jim: Red does not forget to defend or he would lose instead![/DhtmlXQ_comment73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment89]And black ran out time.||Victory was awarded to red.||The following moves have been provided to show the final kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment89]
[DhtmlXQ_comment95]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment95]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_63]And it would also be a red victory.||jim: I have added a few more moves to show the beginner why it is a checkmate win for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_63]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]If K5=6, red would checkmate with C5=4.||If K5+1, red would checkmate with R6+1.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_64]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_67]Jim: Red cannot choose the elbow horse as that file is protected by the black cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_67]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_69]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_66]Red would also win with the same moves should black play E3+5.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_73]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_71]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_73]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_73]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_71]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_65]And black would lose his chariot.||Jim: I think that red could go for a checkmate immediately, instead of just capturing the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_73]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_73]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_73]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_73]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_71]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11_71]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment11_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12_71]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12_71]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13_69]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment13_69]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14_50]And things would not be looking good for red.||Jim: R3-2 was the move given in the internet file I found.||However, it would seem that black could have played H6+4 to capture the red chariot for the definite win![/DhtmlXQ_comment14_50]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15_52]Jim: This would seem to be much simpler and more effective.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15_52]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_47]And black would lose his chariot!||Jim: For beginners, I have added a few more moves to show why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_47]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16_49]Jim: And the black chariot is done for. If it moves R3=5, it would be captured by the cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17_34]And black would also be prepared to play C1=7 and would still have an attack.||Red would have a headache.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18_20]And it would be a complex game whereby both sides would have various issues to deal with.||This would also be better than the actual game played for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19_4]And black's formation would be very stable and versatile.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19_4]
