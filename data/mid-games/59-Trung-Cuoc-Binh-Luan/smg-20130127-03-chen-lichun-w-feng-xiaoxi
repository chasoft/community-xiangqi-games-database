[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20130127 03 Chen LiChun W Feng XiaoXi||||This midgame situation was reached when GuangDong's Chen LiChun took on Feng XiaoXi from SiChuan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Black has gained an elephant but her other chess pieces are still too scattered to offer back up or  continue attacking.||Red made use of this fact and started to make moves that limited the movement of the black pieces.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]There were many reasons for black making this move.||First of all, this was to discourage red from playing R6=8 as black could then play P3+1 to defend.||Secondly, black had hoped that after making this move, she could follow up her attack with C3=1, thereby adding pressure on red.||However, black's assumptions have been to ideal, as the speed of red's attack is far more faster than black's.||Taking into consideration the above analyses, black should have played C3=1 as it would be a more stubborn move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And red's horse sounds the horn for attack.||Black is left with only one chariot and how can such a lonely piece defend?||This is one very important point that black had left out in her analysis of the game in the past few moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Ouch. This move was made too carelessly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Red was perhaps too excited with a chance to attack and attacked too quickly.||E3+5 would have been better now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]Red's mistake gave black a breather and she quickly changes moves her king to safety.||After the slight change in formation, the black chariot would be poised to attack now.||It is now red's turn to be oblivious of black's potential to attack.||By moving the advisor to the palace corner, she had made an unwise move.||C5=6 to block the black chariot would be better now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Red had not played E3+5 and thus gave black's chariot much room to move in this rank. This would have drastic implications on the game.||If red tried to play C7=4 to attempt the kill discussed in the previous move, black could now choose to defend with R4=5![/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Red's moves over the past few rounds are " A check followed by an attack �????�(Jim: searched the AXF lit, no direct translation...). According to the rules, red must changer her moves or lsoe.||And red, seeing that the chariot-horse-cannon combination would not seem to be able to do much, decided on another strategy.||This elephant move would seemingly threaten to the black cannon, but in actual fact, its main goal is to limit the movement of the black chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment37]Black had not seen the real implications of E3+5 and played this cannon instinctively. This would be the start of black's downfall.||R4+1 to prevent the red cannon from traversing would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]Red won the game.||This was a brilliant sacrifice from red.||Jim: I have added the final moves to show why red won the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]Checkmate!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]And red could play A5+6 now. Red would still be in the pilot's seat.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]And red would play C5-1 on the next move to prepare to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]And red would be prepared to checkmate.||Jim: For beginners, I have added a few moves to show why this is a kill for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]H6+7 would have been better as the black chariot cannot leave the bottom rank. Red's cannon would be prepared to play C5+4 should the chariot dare to leave![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]And black would still have a hard time trying to counter red's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]And black's cannon at the palace corner would offer a certain degree of defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]
