[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120808 What would you do if you were GM Yang part 2 ||||This game was played in Wenzhou way back in 1965 in a friendly between four provinces in China.||Guangdong's Yang Guanlin takes on arch nemesis, Shanghai's He Shunan in this game. Yang opened the game with the Central cannon and used the riverbank cannon variation while He answered with the Screen horse defense. He had utilized the left elephant with ranked chariot variation. ||As seen from the board, black's horse is threatening red's chariot.||Yang's turn. ||Jim: He Shunan was one of the greatest player way back in the 50-60's. He was a mentor to GM Hu Ronghua and was eligible for the title of Grandmaster but unfortunately, he passed away before being able to receive that coveted title.||Back to the game...||What would you do if you were GM Yang?!|||| ||2009?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]In Xiangqi circles, GM Yang Guanlin was fondly called the Demon's Uncle. And he shows precisely why with this move. A brilliant, extraordinary play!||By sacrificing the cannon, (the black elephant can  take it...), the tables were turned on black, just like that. ||Black's turn to be under pressure...||This is a brilliant move because it not only prevents black's horse from capturing the chariot, it actually threatens and skewers black's entire riverbank. Brilliant![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]In the other variations, red would still have the supreme upper hand![/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Even if black played E5+7, it would still be to red's advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]By retreating the chariot to shoo away the pesky horse, Yang returns the material gain he had accumulated, in exchange for control of the entire chess board.||Experienced and wily play, showing a deep understanding of the entire board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]Short and simple. With this exchange, black has already pinned all the major black pieces and has the lead firmly in hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Another out of the blue attack!||It would seem that red gave up pinning black's cannon and chariot for no apparent reason...BUT red actually threatens to go for a kill with the elbow horse in this one. And because of this fact, red still has the black cannon pinned, for if it leaves that throat rank, an elbow horse checkmate would ensue.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]Jim: H7+6 would checkmate should the cannon leave the the throat rank![/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]And black would lose his cannon or the game now!||Red wins![/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]Jim: I added this variation to show the beginner why the black cannon cannot move the cannon away from the throat rank...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]checkmate!||This is why the black cannon is still pinned to the throat rank![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]Red would still have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_2]If black took the offer...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]It is clear that red has the advantage!||Red's chariot still has the black cannon and chariot pinned while the other chariot can play R4+2 to gain material. The red horse is ready to attack too.||Black on the other hand, has a horse badly positioned. The free chariot would need to make at least one more move to become a threat again.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_2]It black tried for an exchange....[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]And red would be still much better off![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_19]
