[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120623c maneuvering your pieces to save yourself||This is the flip side of the coin when compared to the second example. ||With good maneuvering skills, one can resolve threats and even overturn the tables!||In this example, black has a full blown attack going on, and at the same time is poised to gain material. ||Red's 3rd horse seems lost for good, but Red manages to save himself with a series of spectacular maneuvers!  ||Red first....[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red threatens to capture black's chariot with C8=5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And red goes for the same ruse again.||This time, red threatens to play H5+6 for a sacrifice check before playing R8=5 to gain the black chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]One threat resolved...[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And by maneuvering the red horse, red has decimated black's offense. The game starts afresh, with red in the lead now![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And although red does not have an immediate kill, red is up material wise and has the better positioning of all the chess pieces.||Red's game, without a shadow of a doubt![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_11]And after red uses his two horses to exchange for black's chariot, red has a very brutal attack which is faster than black's attack and would be too much for black to handle![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_11]
