[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121209 03 Sun QingLi W Li AiDong||||Jim: this is the third analysis given in the file. ||Important principles are shown here. ||||As seen from the diagram, this was the midgame reached in round 9 of competition. KaiLuan's Sun QingLi went up against famed SiChuan Master Li AiDong.||Red has the advantage of the 7th filed pawn and is about to cross the river.||Black's pieces are not in very good formation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]And black retreats the cannon to prevent it from crossing the river. This is perhaps the best solution that black can come up with in this situation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]As red is unable to advance his pawn across the river, he decides to try something else.||These two horse moves are made at a nice time. Once the horse has reached its current position, black's weak flank is even more prominent.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Although this move may not decrease the pressure felt by black, there are not many other choices either.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]As red's troops are about to attack, black has much trouble defending. That is why black decides to try to exchange material, hoping that it would indirectly dilute the attack that red is planning on red's left flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]And red makes his intentions clear with this move, targetting the elephant. ||Red could also consider playing H7+9. As black's right flank is relatively empty, H7+9 would offer many attacking options.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And black must make this move now.||If red were allowed to play R4+4 to block the elephants, the game would be over soon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Jim: Or black might have a chance of turning the tables with R8+8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Black advanced his chariot to the throat rank first, before retreating the same chariot to its current position. ||This is to prevent the red cannon from moving to the left to aid in the attack. ||This is a good use of the "??" tactic. Jim: Zwischenzug is perhaps the closest that English Chess has to offer relating to this tactic.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]This is not as desirable as R8+8 as it would apply a definite amount of pressure on red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]And this move is uncalled for.||Red would have won the game with R4+4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Stubborn defense from black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]Using a powerful attacking cannon to exchange for black's non-functioning horse is not a wise move.||R4=2 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Delivering a check now would seem to rash. ||Red should have played C3=9 to keep his options open, before making this H9+7 move. Red would take a shorter time to win as compared to the actual game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment44]In this game, it is quite a waste that red has lost so many chances to attack. Luckily for red, he still had a cross river pawn. ||The battle lasted till move 72 whereby red won.[/DhtmlXQ_comment44]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]And red would move the chariot to the left flank. By then, Red's 2r1h1c combination would be too much for black to handle.||Jim: I think there was a typing error in the file that I found. It gave red's next move as R2=9 which would be giving a free meal to black's horse. R2=7 would seem more reasonable.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]And black would be helpless in the attack to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]GM Zhang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]And red would be significantly faster than black in going in for the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]And red would checkmate with C9+1 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]Jim: I added this variation for beginners to explain why black cannot move the advisor.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_28]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_10]GM Zhang's recommendations[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_12]And red would be prepared to play C8+1 on the next move. Red would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_12]And red could continue his attack with this move!||Jim: I have added a few more moves to show the beginner why this is not a sacrifice by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_16]And red threatens to checkmate by retreating the front cannon. Black would have to move the advisor and red's remaining chariot would attack accordingly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_3]And red would be in trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_3]
