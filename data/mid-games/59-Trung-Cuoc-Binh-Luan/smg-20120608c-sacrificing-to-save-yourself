[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120608c Sacrificing to save yourself||||Sometimes, when your opponent is about to win the game, the only thing you can do is to sacrifice a chess piece to save yourself. By means of a sacrifice, you slow his attack. Although you would be down material wise, after the sacrifice, you would be able to simplify the game to your advantage, or aim for draw.||As seen in this example, red has the material upperhand, but black is ready to win any moment with the chariots and cannon. ||The only way that red can live to see another day is by means of a fat offering: the chariot...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]No other offering can appease black's anger...?[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]As can be seen, with the sacrifice, red forces black's chariot to a bad position, which would require a few more moves, thereby buying precious time.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And black offers a sacrifice of his own![/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]And red answers with a brilliant move of his own.||Red would only be able to set a trap to capture the black cannon![/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And it would be a draw as neither side would be able to win. Not bad for red who nearly lost the game 12 moves ago![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]and it would be a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]And it would be a draw according to the rules if neither side changes their moves![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]And the storm has passed.||It could be anybody's game now. Black's threat of a checkmate has been completely eradicated.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]And red would play H5+7 to eradicate the pawn for a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_17]
