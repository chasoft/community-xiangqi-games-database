[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120613c be bold do not chicken out ||||Xiangqi can be said to be a battle of wills. The will to attack, the will to counter, the will to hold on and the will to claw back from behind is a must. Like all warriors in ancient times, bravery and the willingless to fight till the end is a basic requirement in the game of Xiangqi.||However, sometimes in the course of a game, there may arise situations whereby certain bold moves are questionable or in doubt, forcing the player to switch tactics or retreat or go on the defensive. If assessment of the situation shows that it is still viable, one should not be passive  and instead be proactive.||In this game, black has red in a chokehold. Red's is in deep trouble everywhere. Material is about to be lost...There is no way out for Red...||Let us see how Red fights on...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black makes a mistake with this move, ignoring red's possible counter. ||E3+5 would have been better and black would be able to hold on to the lead firmly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]And Red pounces back immediately!||Red focuses his moves on the poor positioning of the black chariots. Good move!||Red would proceed to attack from the center.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And black still has not understood the gravity of his situation, and insists on gaining material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And black would notbe able to handle blac's aggressions with the chariots and cannon.||Red is now on the winning end![/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_11]Red threatens with a checkmate now.||Red would then proceed to gain back lost material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_11]And red would be able to gain back lost material![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_11]
