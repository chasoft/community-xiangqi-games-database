[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121209 02 Zhang Qiang L Lu ZhengRong ||||This was the second file from the internet file.||Commentary is given by GM Zhang GuoFeng unless otherwise specified. Note: Black is Master Li Qun, not GM Li LaiQun who is not very active nowadays.||||In round 8 in this year's competition, HuoCheTou's Chen QiMing faced YunNan's Li Qun in this exciting midgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]For this move, red could have considered R6+6 to disrupt black's defensive formation and then counter black's attack accordingly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]And after black's cannon has taken the central pawn, Black immediately fortifies his defense so that red would not be able to spring a counter.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]A natural move to make.||If red played R1=4 now, black would move R9=8 and red's chariot on the 4th file would still be in an embarassing predicament. It would still be pinned as the black would be threatening with R9+9.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]It may seem that black is trying to limit the development of the left side horse with this move, but in actual fact, this is to facilitate movement and development of the black chariot. ||Jim: Please click on the variation below to see GM Zhang's explanation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And red tries to be aggressive, looking for chances to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Black chooses to develop his chariot in this manner, while at the same time controlling the riverbank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is not a very wise move from black, allowing red's pawn to cause mischief.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Red cannot play P3=4 now or black would just simply take it![/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]This was a rather rough move from red.  C3=4 would have been better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]And black has managed to surprise red as you will see in the moves that follow.[/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And red is forced to play this move out of desperation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]At this stage ni the game, although red has a cross river pawn, but his forces are too dispersed to do much.||Black, on the other hand, has a very threatening central cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment28]And red makes this move to try to make use of the discovered attack tactic. The idea is good, but black has neglected the potential of the central cannon. ||R6-3 to defend the pawn rank would be better as it would decrease black's attacking options while at the same time allow red to play R6=4 to threaten the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment28]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]The perfect time to push this pawn forward!!!!||Black makes use of the fact that the red chariot has limited the red king's escape route with this move. ||The grave consequences of red's R2=4 is seen clearly now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment35]With this move, black limits the movement of red's chariot on the rib file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment36]Playing H9+7 might be better than this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]GOOD MOVE!!!||Black does not hurry to gain back lost material but concentrates on his attack.||This was another move that red has not expected.||The culmination of black's surprise attack and red's inability to read the game accurately is the reason for red's loss.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And red makes this move out of desperation.||Otherwise, black would would go for the kill with R8=3.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment41]!!! And after the all imporatnt elephant is captured, the entire red defense is decimated.[/DhtmlXQ_comment41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment59]And in the past few moves, black's chariot have tangoed right and left to victory. Black wins as red resigned.||Jim: for beginners, if red played C8=5 to resolve this check, black would mate with C2+7.||If red moved the central advisor, black would simply play R9=5 for the throat cutting checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment59]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_36]GM Zhang's recommendations.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_36]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]An insane move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]And red would lose his chariot.||Jim: I have added a few more moves should the visitor wonder why playing R5+2 by red now is also impossible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_37]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_41]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_41]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]And black would bully red's central chariot with P3+1 on the next move.||Black is not far away from the victory.||Jim: for beginners, the central chariot cannot budge from the central file or black would go for the throat ranked checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]GM Zhang's advised move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]And red would have the huge advantage in the game!!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]And red would be much better after capturing the central pawn on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_18]GM Zhang: this move cannot be made![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]As black would just simply capture it without fear.||Jim: GM Zhang's comment stopped here. The following are my interpretations of her comments.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]Jim: And black would be ready for the final kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]GM Zhang's recoemmendations[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]And black would be much better as compared to the actual game played.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]And black's left flank would now be relatively empty and be prone to attack by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8_15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_12]If black tried to prevent black from playing P1+1 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_13]Black would play this move, preparing to push P3+1! The black cannon would now be aiming for a smothered cannon checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]And if red countered with this move to prevent black's P3+1 ...[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]Black would make this move and the black chariot would still be developed.||Jim: As seen in this diagram, black would still get to develop his chariot while at the same time limit the movement of the red horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_15]
