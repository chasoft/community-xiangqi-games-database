[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120808 What would you do if you were GM Yang part 2||||In July 1974, the Chinese National Singles Championship was held in Guangzhou. Jiangsu's Xu Rengji took on GM Yang. We start at move 21.||Red has used the 59 Cannons with Pawn Ranked Chariot variation and subsequently attacked black's central pawn. Black on the other hand, started the game with the Edge Cannon for Chariot Exchange Variation of the Screen Horse Defense.||A simple analysis of the game shows that red's rib  filed cannon is attacking the black chariot. If the black chariot moves away, red would go for the elbow horse checkmate. One would worry for black. ||But after analysing the board, the great GM decided to go ahead with Red's plans...||What would you do if you were GM Yang Guanlin?||Black's turn to move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]!!!||GM Yang decided that one chariot was insufficent...So a second chariot sacrifice was made!||Jim: Holy shit...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And black is forced to return a sacrifice!!! This move was made out of desperation to allow the red chariot to play R7=2 to save himself.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Jim: Ouch, just within a span of 7 moves, black has concentrated ALL his forces on one side of the board.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Black wins!||Brilliant!!!!!||Jim: I have added the following moves to show the beginner why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]And black would be just a few moves away from a kill![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]Still hopeless...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_11]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_2]This is what might have happened should red accept the sacrifice...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]And there is no way that red can redeem himself from the wrath of the humble pawn![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_8]For beginners, if red played E3+1, black would simply checkmate with C7+3 for the double cannons checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]Horse Cannon checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]
