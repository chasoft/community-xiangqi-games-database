[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120613b beware of making inefficient moves||||In an actual game, your moves should all be targeted at your goal and be as efficient or 'tight' as possible. Each move should link up with the next move and as efficiently as possible. The continuity of the moves made should be for a common aim or goal. If they are not efficient enough or do not work towards the same goal, you might lose tempo or even hand over the control of the game to your opponent. Such moves are known as? ? ? in chinese or loosely translated slow hands.||In this example, red's chess pieces are well positioned, have much space to move and has a coordinated attack going on.||But black has more material and his cannon is attacking red's elephant on black's 7th file. Black is applying a certain amount of pressure on red's defense.||Red makes a bad move under such circumstances which hands black the win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Under most circumstances, this might be a good move to make. However, in this game, the speed of this move is questionable. ||This is because after black plays C7+8 to capture the elephant for the check, a wrench would be thrown into red's attack. Red would be forced to halt his attack for the time being.||R1=3 by black would be better as it thwarts this black threat. Red would still be in control and could wait and see as to what black would come up next and adjust his attack accordingly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]Black's turn to try to halt red's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Thus far, all of black's moves are well coordinated and smooth flowing. ||This ranked chariot move is a very good move as it targets red's empty left flank.||Just within a span of 5 moves, the tables have turned and black is now attacking while red is forced to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Cannot play R2+1 or black would have an seething attack after C8=2![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Correct![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Good move!||This horse sacrifice allows the black chariot to be mobile and unobstructed and still allow it to move R1=8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And red prepares to gain material with consecutive discovered checks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment38]And black would not only be able to hold off red's  attack, he would have material advantage.||Red's defeses are also wiped out. A win should not be far.[/DhtmlXQ_comment38]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And red would be on the winning end.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]Black threatens to checkmate with the double cannons. Red can only move K5=4 or A5+4, either way, red would have a very hard time handling black's aggressions.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]
