[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121209 01 Zhang Qiang L Lu ZhengRong ||||Jim: this was a file I found on the internet. It seeme to be a column from the periodical XiangQi and dealt with midgames in 2003. According to the limited data given found together with the file, it seemed to have been commented by GM Zhang GuoFeng.||||As can be seen in the diagram on the left. This game was played in round 7 of the A league in this year's competition. Red was Bejing's Master Zhang Qiang while black was JiangSu's Lu ZhengRong. ||Red had advanced his pawn not long after the game started, showing his intentions of attacking from the center. ||Will his goal be achieved?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red lets his central pawn advance again for the second time. This is to prevent black from playing H9+8 to attack his riverbank chariot, while at the same time creating space for his riverbank chariot to move and manipulate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]A natural move to make after advancing the central pawn.||The target of attack for this red chariot would be black's horse on red's 6th file. ||Jim: For beginners, when a horse is placed at this position, that is moving H2+4/H8+6 for the first move, it is called a ???. I have yet to think of a decent translation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And black voluntarily breaks up his linked cannon defence. This a direct counter to red's R9+1. ||This is a creative response to red's impending R9=6 threat as after this move, should red play R9=6, black would play H4+6 to escape capture.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Perhaps R9=6 would be a better move.||In this way, ||3. R9=6 H4+6,||4, H7+5 would give red more options for attack in the game. The black horse at the palcorner would be fixed there temporarily.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Red intends to attack the central elephant with this move. Perhaps this was what red had planned all along when he sacrificed the central pawn.||Unfortunately, in this instance, this would be considered a little rash. Attacking the center is a good plan, but red's reinforcements are not in place yet.||Playing R9=6 would be better now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]And since red has not played R9=6, black decides to make this move to control this all important rib file first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Jim: and red is now forced to make this move. Black's chariot has already controlled the rib file (red's 6th), and if black were allowed to play R1=2, there would not be much room for this ranked chariot to move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]It may seem that black's two consecutive chariot moves looked slow and inefficient, in reality, black's chariot is now superbly positioned and basically has control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]And black seizes the chance to make his move.||Red's solitary horse on the 4th file is alone and without backup. Black targets this glaring weakness and maneuvers his horse in this fashion to attack it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]For the past few rounds, black has played the game with much efficiency.||At this point in time, black has finished deploying his forces to the best possible locations and is about to start his attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]This moe was made to allow the remaining black chariot into the game (with R1=4).||Jim: It should be obvious by now what the GM meant by black's cross-river chariot having excellent positioning.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And black does NOT give red any breathing chance.||Fierce play![/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And black plays it straightforward to gain material.||Once this is done, black is guaranteed victory.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment40]And black's attack has been terrorizing. Black continued his attack until he won the game not long after. ||Jim: The remaining moves are not shown. But it would be black's 1r1h1c5p2a2e vs red's miserable 1r1h1c2p1a1e. The pawn advantage and positional advantage of black is too much for red now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment40]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]And black would be much better.||Red would never allow this to happen.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
