[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20120804 GM Yang Guanlin 01||||This game was played almost 80 years ago, in July 1954. It was one of GM Yang's early games.||In this game, GM Yang sacrifices his chariot, attacks the elephant and allows his chariot, cannon and pawn to join forces for the final kill.||The event was a friendly held in July 1954 between Guangzhou vs Tianjin. Yang (black) took on Ma Guoliang (red). Ma had started the game with the Angel's Pawn and Yang had countered with the Thundering Defense.||Black to move...||What would you do if you were GM Yang?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]!!!||||GM Yang sacrifices his chariot to remove the pesky central cannon. This can be considered to be a flying dagger. Only the bold would dare to initiate an attack, targeting red's empty left flank with this move.||Jim: It is obvious that red has the stronger attack up till this stage. With this move, black not only gets rid of the pesky central cannon, he allows his black cannon to start an attack on the empty left flank. The beauty of the game is how GM  Yang maneuvers the rest of left flank to the opposite side of the board for the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]If red played A5+6 instead...||Jim: black threatens to capture the red central chariot with R2+9 and then R2-6 (discovered check) if red did not move the horse. By moving the horse, red's central cannon can protect the chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]The horse joins in the fight!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Jim: Black cannot take the black horse because... I have added a variation to explain why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Jim: GM Yang does not forget to defend against red's elbow horse attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]It was suggested that perhaps H7+8 would have been  even more efficient!||Nevertheless, take a seat and watch how GM Yang wins the game![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Jim: This would alleviate the pressure of black's smothered cannon checkmate (C7+7) and thus allow red to move his chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Jim: Red tempts black with this sacrifice. If black actually took it, red would checkmate with H6+7. Red tries to slow black's attack with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And GM Yang moves the elephant to the river bank to act as a cannon mount! This move is like another dagger stuck in Red's heart.||Jim: This is brilliant because not only black attacks the baseline elephant, it allows the black cannon to traverse the board to C7=4, thereby concentrating his forces on red's left flank for the final kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]Jim: And red is more or less done for now. Red's final threat of an elbow horse checkmate is eliminated and this cannon would aid in the final kill, now that it controls this rib file.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment24]If red chose to move H6-7 instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment29]Jim: Another sacrifice![/DhtmlXQ_comment29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment33]This was the final actual move played.||Black could also have played R4=5 for the kill.||Black won.||Jim: I have added the rest of the moves to show the beginner the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]A faster alternative.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_33]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_35]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]Jim: This is to explain why black has a checkmate and why red had to try to prolong his life with C8=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]If red tried this instead...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_24]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]And black would claim victory!||Jim: I have added the final few move to show the beginner why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_29]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_31]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]Why the horse is poisoned...[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]And just in the span of 6-7 moves, black gains control of the game. A win would not be too far away![/DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]Black would not be far way from a kill with the double cannon chariot checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_11]
