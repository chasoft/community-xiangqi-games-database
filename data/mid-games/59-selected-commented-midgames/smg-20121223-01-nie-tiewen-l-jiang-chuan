[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121223 01 Nie TieWen L Jiang Chuan  ||||Jim: This is a continuation of commented analyses by GM Zhang GuoFeng in her column. HeiLongJiang Province's Master Nie TieWen took on BeiJing's Master Jiang Chuan in this game. I did a little bit of searching, and the two of them started the game with a pawn vs pawn opening. The competition was one whereby Masters or Grandmasters were eligible in 2004.||||GM Zhang:||As can be seen, this was the midgame reached when Hei Long Jiang's Nie TieWen took on Beijing's Jiang Chuan.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This is a commonly used tactic, protecting the horse indirectly with by moving the chariot.||Jim: For beginners, if black did play R7+1, red would play C5+4 for the discovered check to capture the black chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]And black decided not to accept the challenge face on. A wise choice.||That is because other than C5=3, red would now also have C8-1 as another option to attack the black chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]And red's chariot controls the rib file, preparing to launch a full scale attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]All of red's pieces are well developed and it is clear that red has the advantage in this one.||Perhaps red felt that his chances were good, so he rushed his moves by advancing this horse.||R1=2 to allow his ranked chariot into action would have been better.||More patience would have been better for red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Another folly. Red's has been too hotheaded with this move.||Red should still have played R1=2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]CORRECT MOVE!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Red has linked horses and also a very menacing central cannon. In view of this, black felt that if he took the horse carelessly, he would be in deep trouble.||That is why he made this brilliant move. Instead of attacking the red central horse, he decided to cut of its reinforcements. Nice move![/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment18]Advancing the cannon now was to allow black to try to dampen red's central cannon attack.||Unfortunately, this also revealed another target for red to attack.||P7+1 would have been better![/DhtmlXQ_comment18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]Folly! Red just wasted a good chance to attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment20]The most important thing for black now would be to relieve the pressure applied from the center, which is why he made this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And red rushed his horse again. This move restricted the available space that his horse could wonder.||R6+1 would be a better move, testing black's response.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment26]And all of red's attack has been effectively dissipated. Black has wrenched control of the game away from red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment26]
[DhtmlXQ_comment34]And after the past few rounds, red is one major piece down.||Black eventually won the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment34]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]And black should make this move to have the advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]GM Zhang's recommended moves.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]And red would have a very powerful attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]And red would still be much better![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]And black would have imprisoned the red horse!||Black would be prepared to gain material now with C7+2.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_20]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]And after the horse sacrifice, red would now have a seething attack in place.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]Weaknesses could still be found in Black's defense, red should have been patient and waited for his chance rather than attack so rashly.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_7]And red would be prepared to go for the elbow horse attack (H6+4 followed by H4+3). ||Black felt that trying to slow this horse would efficient, so he decided to capture the central pawn instead, tempting red to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_7]
