[DhtmlXQ_comment0]smg 20121122 01 Zhuang HongMing D Zhao RuQuan||??? ?? ???||This is the first of 4 games commented by female GM Zhang GuoFeng when she edited a midgames section in the periodical XiangQi back in 2004.||The games she selected in this entry were the ones  that were played inthe 11th Asian Singles Championships in Dec 2003.||Very practical comments from the fiery GM!||||"The 11th Asian XiangQi Championships started on the 13th of Dec 2003 in Singapore. After 7 rounds of competition, China's Huang HaiLin and Wang LinNa emerged as champions in the male and female's section respectively. I have selected severe interesting midgames to share with the readers."||"In this game, Philippines Zhuang HongMing goes up against Hong Kong's Zhao RuQuan."[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Charging the central pawn now is not a good idea as black has yet to move the advisors or the elephants. ||Perhaps playing R4+2 to cause mischief to the black cannon would be better. With R4+2, red can prevent black from trying P7+1 and also force black to play C7+5. After playing C7+5, black's attack on this file would be weakened![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And red is forced to play this move.   ||Playing P5+1 would be to black's advantage now![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]H3-4 is a possibe option.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment16]Black's 3rd file is an area of concern. With this move, black gets to address this flaw. If not, once red's other chariot moves R9=8, the entire right black flank would be under much stress.[/DhtmlXQ_comment16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And red targets black's pawn rank. This is a key move to make.||If black gets to play R8+3 to control this rank, black would have the say in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment39]Black uses the linked cannons on his throat rank to defend. There is no opening for red to attack.||At the same time, black's horse threatens with the elbow horse or palcorner horse attack.||Black's cross river pawn is another major headache for red. ||Red is on the receiving end. That is why red decides to use the AXF rules to try to force a draw!||Jim: The chinese term for black's cannon defense is called ???. Heck, I do not how to translate it... a ?? is a stick that is used to carry two baskets tied to each end. A person would simply place his shoulder under the middle of the rod to carry the loads.[/DhtmlXQ_comment39]
[DhtmlXQ_comment46]Black has the advantage and is not pleased with a draw, so he decided to try this move. But in retrospect, this move was a little forced.[/DhtmlXQ_comment46]
[DhtmlXQ_comment49]And red misses out on an opportunity to win gain the lead in the game! ||Please click on the variation below to see GM Zhang's suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment65]Draw!||Red sees that he has no chance of a win and decides to opt go for a draw instead.||According to the AXF rules, an attack followed by a check would be a draw if neither side changes their moves "????????".[/DhtmlXQ_comment65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_65]Jim: I had been wondering if this was feasible...but I guess not after GM Zhang explains why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_65]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_66]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]And although black's king is in a precarious position, it would still be a draw as there is nothing that red can do![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_68]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]GM Zhang's suggested move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_49]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_53]And black's defense would be shattered. ||Red would have much more of a chance to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_53]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_55]And red would have a high chance of gaining material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_55]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]Another possibility by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]And black would have a very solid defence and red would have to spend some time trying to find an area of weakness to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_18]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_9]GM Zhang's explains why this is not feasible.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]And red's attack would be significantly slower and weaker than black's attack from the flanks. ||In openings whereby the central pawn is charged, the ability to be quicker than your opponent is key to success. That is why red's P5+1 earlier would have a significant impact on the game as it greatly slowed red's attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_16]
