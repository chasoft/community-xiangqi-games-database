[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg tactics zugzwang 01||Game adapted from <<????>> by ??? et al.||In this game, red has black under much pressure with the 2 chariots. Unfortunately, it is still not enough to warrant a kill.||A red cannon at the center is needed for the final blow.||Black on the other hand, can defend and has his own attack on red's right flank (black's left relatively). ||Red decides to use the Zugzwang tactic.||||====||||Tactic: Zugzwang ?? 01||||?? Zugzwang is the tactic discussed here. ||In Xiangqi, this is quite a commonly used tactic, be it in the opening, midgame or engame. Zugzwang is the closest English/German counterpart I can find for this often used Xiangqi tactic. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_tactics is the Wiki page on International Chess tactics.||When you use this tactic, you force your opponent to make a move which follows your game plan instead of his, so that you can gain initiative, material or have other gains. It is an aggressive play. Normally, you threaten your opponent with a checkmate, or kill or fork...etc..., forcing your opponent to resolve this threat by moving his pieces to YOUR advantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Red threatens with a kill, C7+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black is forced to block this kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Red uses the Zugzwang...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]There is no way that black can resolve the impending checkmate of R5+1 now.||This is a simple example.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
