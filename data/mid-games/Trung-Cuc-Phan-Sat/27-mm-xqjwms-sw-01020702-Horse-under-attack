[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020702 Horse under attack||Black first to move. As can be seen from the board, should black move the black horse to safety, protect the horse or sacrifice it to advance the cannon?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Correct choice to make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]And not only does black regain lost material, black has also obtained a winning position.||||Conclusion:||When your horse is under attack, the following must be taken note of:||1) usually you would be faced with three options: a) moving your horse to safety, b) protecting your horse, c) sacrificing for greater gains. These three options should be compared to find the best answer to your predicament.||2) when you decide to sacrifice the horse, you must plan your attack in the correct direction and  your attack must carry through and not run out of steam||3) the attack you choose if you decide to sacrifice must have a very clear goal, and must give you a distinct advantage to get you closer to a win||4) the tempo gained with the sacrifice must allow you to carry on till the end||5) your attack must be continuous, with the goal of obtaining material or going for the kill||6) if the chance arises for you to kill, do not be greedy and go after the opponent's major pieces. instead, zoom in and focus on the actual checkmate||7) after obtaining material compensation, you must also have a winning game on hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
