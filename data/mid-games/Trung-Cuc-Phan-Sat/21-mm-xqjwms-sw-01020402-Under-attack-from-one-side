[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020402 Under attack from one side||Question: As can be seen from this example, black's king on the 4th file has already been controlled by red's horse.||Can black save himself?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Yes||As the most threatening piece to black would be red's horse, it is imperative that black tries to get rid of this thorn by chasing the horse away or by an exchange of horses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]As red's threat has been undermined, black would not have to fear and can start launching and attack of his own.||With this move, black gets to destroy red's defense, paving the way for his pawn on the 3rd file to attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]Using the 1r1c combination to try to gain material  by means of a discovered check is an often used tactic in actual play.||In this example, it would also gain tempo for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment27]And black would not be far from winning the game.||||Conclusion:||From the above two examples, we can draw the following conclusions:||a) when the king is attacked from one side, one must block, exchange or try to drive away that offending piece||b) under most circumstances, when your king is attacked from the side, you should try to use your major pieces (r,h,c) as the main material to resolve the opponent's threat. Trying to move your king out of harm's way would often not be a wise choice||c)after the opponent's threat is resolved, one must try to reconsider the current situation and decide how to efficently organize a combinational counter attack||d) your target of choice should be the weakest link on the opponent's side of the board. Usually, this would be the opponent's advisor(s)/elephant(s).[/DhtmlXQ_comment27]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]NO!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]And red would further limit the movement of black's king.||Red would be on the winning side.||That is why the black pawn cannot be pushed forward as it would not be able to prevent C4=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]
