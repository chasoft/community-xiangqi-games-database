[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020202 Under attack on the bottom rank||Question: In this example, if black were to move first, can black save himself and snuff out red's attack on the bottom rank?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Of course, YES!||Red's attack on the bottom rank is hinged on the fact that the horse can away for red to deliver a check (discovered check).||It would follow naturally for black to prevent this by blocking red's horse with this move, thereby denying red an efficient attack.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And at this point in time, black has more material . At the same time, black's chariot has pinned red's cannon and chariot (indirectly), thereby limiting the efficiency of red's attack.||Red would be on the verge of losing.||||Conclusion:||From the above two examples, when your bottom ranked is under heavy attack, we can come to the following conclusions:||a) first of all, you must identify clearly the major attacking piece. Only when this is done, can you plan to attack it or try to exchange material for it. This is the most important step to take!||b) try to use your own pieces to limit or trap that major attacking piece. This would also be a very efficient way of getting yourself out of trouble.||c) and of course, always use the rules to your advantage. (Jim: gentle reminder, the AXF rules and CXA rules are not 100% the same. There are many fundamental differences that would sometimes  result in completely different rulings for the same scenario!)||d) after resolving your opponent's attack on the bottom rank, NEVER forget to maneuver your pieces to better positioning, such that you would not be under attack anymore, or better still, be able to launch a counter of your own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]And this would be a draw!||Red would have wasted a chance to win the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_8]And red would be sure to gain a cannon and black would be in deep trouble.||This manner of attacking is a mistake that many beginners or intermediate players would often make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_3]NO![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]!!!||And red would be able to retrieve lost material while at the same time maintaining his attack.||This is a mistake that many beginners may make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]
