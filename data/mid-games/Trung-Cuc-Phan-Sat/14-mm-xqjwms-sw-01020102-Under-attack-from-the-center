[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020102 Under attack from the center||Question: If black were to move first, would he able to save himself and force a draw?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Yes.||Retreating the chariot for an advisor sacrifice is the key move to forcing a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And because black has an elephant on the third file, red cannot win!||If black did not have the elephant on the third file, red would win instead.||(Jim: Pls see the second board which I have painstakingly prepared...).[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]Black's linked elephants could be able to make idle moves and thus deny red a chance for a pawn checkmate by stalemate.||It would become a draw.||||Conclusion:||From the above two examples, we can draw the following conclusions:||1) when your central file is attacked by the opponent's cannons, one option would be to move your king to one of the rib files , thereby moving it out of harm's way and also gain momentum or turn the tables by threatening with a counter checkmate.||2) after the opponent's attack from the center is resolved, one should then try to concentrate his forces for an attack on the opponent's king or other important material||3) try to organize your material into a functional attacking unit||4) if you are not able to win, try to exchange material. This is usually done by using your stronger piece(s) to try to exchange for the opponent's major attacking piece. If this were not done, your opponent would use that major attacking piece to attack and cause you all sorts of trouble and even the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
