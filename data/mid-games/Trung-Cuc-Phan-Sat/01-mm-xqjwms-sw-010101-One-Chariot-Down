[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 010101 One Chariot Down||As can be seen from the diagram, Red is one chariot down but gets to go first in this example.||Question: What effective play(s) does red have that would make up for the lost chariot?||Under most circumstances, losing a chariot would mean losing the game, and thus, the main issue that red would have to deal with in this game is how to make up for this loss.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]If one were to analyze the positions of red's 1r1c1h, only the horse is placed in a position capable of attack.||That is why, making use of the red horse's potential to attack is the most important move that red can move now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]After the king has come out, what should red's next move be?||R3=6 or C8=6?[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Correct move to make.||Jim: Pls go to the moves in the variation before reading on... (click on the variations listed in the box below)||||From my many years of experience, I have been able to draw the following conclusions:||||a) When you choose to play the cannon to the rib file first, you get a chance to gain material by means of a discovered check.||the opponent would also NOT be able to resolve this threat by consecutive checkmates, thereby increasing the effect of this move.||Another advantage of moving the cannon to the rib file first is that the horse in the elbow position can get to be maneuvered to better positions.||||b) if you chose to move the chariot first to the rib file, you have to make sure that you would still have a very powerful attack or game plan as a follow up before you are allowed a win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]Mistake that most amateurs would make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]And red would be denied any chance of an effective attack.||Jim: I added a few moves to explain why...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_6]Jim: And black would be out of harm's way after moving the king K4=5. Black's material advantage would most probably prevail in the game to come.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_6]
