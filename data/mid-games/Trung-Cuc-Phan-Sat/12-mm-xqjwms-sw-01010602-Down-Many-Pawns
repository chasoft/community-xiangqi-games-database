[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01010602 Down Many Pawns||||Challenge Question: As seen from the board, can red turn the tables if he moved first?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Yes...||This is the crucial move. Advancing the horse to attempt to capture the cannon and chariot at the same time is key.||Prior to this move, it was basically black's 1r1c3p2a2e vs red's 1r1h1p2a2e.||This would usually be a win for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]And black is forced to make this move...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]And red's chariot is bound to capture the black pawn on the rib file.||This is another key move in forcing a draw.||Even if black decided to protect this pawn on the rib file, he would have to sacrifice the pawn on his 8th file and it would still be a draw.||||Conclusion:||When your opponent has many more pawn(s) than you, you must take note of the following:||a) identify the weaknesses in your opponent's formation and try to maneuver you material to attacking positions (like the palcorner horse in example 1). This would force your opponent to be on the defensive end.||b) Then maneuver your pawn to combine with your chariot so that they become a legitimate threat.||c) in the second example, red's horse was not able  to reach any threatening position and his chariot was not able to attack ,that is why red had to choose the draw strategy. The steps taken for forcing a draw were exchanging the black cannon with the horse followed by an exchange of pawns. Another possible strategy would be to try to exchange chariots so that it becomes a draw too.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]And the endgame would simplify to that of 1r1p2a2e d 1r2p2a2e. Of course, red must know the key points to this endgame situation for red to force a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_9]
