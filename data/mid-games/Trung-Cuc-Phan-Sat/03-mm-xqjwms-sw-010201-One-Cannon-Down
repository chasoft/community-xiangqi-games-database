[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 010201 One Cannon Down||Intial analysis:||Red is one cannon down material wise but gets to move first. The black cannon on the bottom rank is menacing. ||Black's weakness would be the poor position of the black chariot.||Red can only get himself out of trouble if he launched an attack there would make up for the cannon deficit.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]The only direct attack that red has.||Red targets the weak central elephant and the black chariot with this move, forcing black to give up the black elephant and thus be able to get himself out of trouble.||Black would be in a dilemma now.||What should black do?||The author has come to the following conclusions:||[color=red] a) if black needed to sacrifice his chariot to protect the elephant, it must be done so that black would still have a playable game after the sacrifice.[/color]||||[color=blue] b) if black were to sacrifice the chariot,  it must be done in such a way that black would be able to thwart red's impending checkmate.[/blue]||The second point is especially important.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And red would win, threatening to checkmate with R4=5 on the next move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]If black tried to sacrifice his chariot to save himself...||Jim:no more moves or explanation were given[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]And red would have even the odds and still have a very playable game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]
