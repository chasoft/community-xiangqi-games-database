[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 010102 One Chariot Down||Question: If red were to move first, is there any way that red can force for a draw???||Jim: Think before you click on!!![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Yes.||Sacrificing the horse is the best move under such circumstances.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Correct move for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]And red would have managed to even the material disadvantage.||This would be a draw.||Conclusion:||From the above two examples, we can arrive at the following conclusions,||||1. When you are one chariot down, you can only survive only if you move first and make FULL use of the remaining material to attack. Only then will you be able to get yourself out of that mess.||2. When you are able to go in for the kill, DO SO! Do not be bothered with material gain.||3. When you are not able to kill, aim for material gains instead, and target the opponent's chariot as a first priority.||4. Commonly made mistakes are the ones shown in the variations||5. The first attacking move should be the move that starts the attack or prepares for the kill.||6. Your ultimate goal would be to try to even the odds for at least a draw or even better, to create a winning environment.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]Mistake![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]And red would gain a chariot.||Jim: I have added a few more moves to explain to the beginner why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]And red would have successfully evened the deficit  in terms of material disadvantage.||The game would still be undecided and red would have given himself a chance to do better in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]Wrong.||This mistake would often be made by amateurs and is quite a big mistake.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]And black would be out of harm's way for the moment!||Black would now be threatening to gain material and thus further increase his advantage in the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]
