[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020301 Under attack on the rib files||As can be seen from the board, black's rib file (black's 4th file in this instance) is  under attack.||Luckily for black, it is black's turn to move and black can advance the chariot to try to capture red's cannon. He would be able to turn the tables.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This is the key move for getting black out of trouble.||Red's elbow horse has already limited the black king to his 4th file and red could be prepared to play A5+6 or R2-1 to go for the final kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And black is now temporarily safe from red's attack.||Black would now be prepared to move either C7=2 or C7=5, whereby both moves would be threatening to attack red.||Black has successfully turned the tables.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]Jim: Or H6+7 would checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]Jim: And black would have successfully gained material, controlled this rib file while at the same time be  prepared to start launching a counter attack of his own.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]Mistake![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_2]![/DhtmlXQ_comment2_2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]And red would be threatening to checkmate with R6+1 or play R6=7 to capture black's chariot on the next move. Either way, things would look bleak for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_12]
