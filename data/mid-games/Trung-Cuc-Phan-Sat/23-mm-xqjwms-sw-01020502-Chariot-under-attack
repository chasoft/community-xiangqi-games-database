[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020502 Chariot under attack||As seen from the diagram, black's horse is attacking red's chariot on the 4th file.||If red were to move first, what would be a common mistake to make?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This would seem to be a good move to make as red would now be threatening to attack the central elephant.||In actual fact, however, red has been taken advantage off with this move!||A better move to make would have been R4-1![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]This was forced play by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]And red tries to salvage his situation with another fierce sacrificial play.||Moving the chariot to the rib file would be a tempt by red.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]The best defensive move that black can offer![/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]Jim: Black now threatens to checkmate with C6+8.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment22]And black would be prepared to capture the red chariot on the next move with the 1r1c combination.||Red is in deep trouble.||This was an actual game played in the 14th 5 Rams Cup. Red was JiangSu's GM Xu TianHong while black was GuangDong's Xu YinChuan.||||Conclusion:||When your chariot is under attack, you must take note of the following:||a) you may attempt to capture the opponent's chariot so that your opponent would be under attack||b) try NOT to move your chariot out of harm's way passively, as other material may be in trouble||c) when you decide to sacrifice your chariot, you must at least gain back material of the same value or be able to launch a powerful attack of your own||d) when you do indeed manage to gain back material compensation, you must try to prevent your major pieces from being under attack and at the same time, try to attack the opponent||e) if you do decide to move your chariot out of harm's way, it must be REALLY moved out of harm's way and be free of future traps or attacks on it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment22]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]Checkmate![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]And red would have lost material and black would have the upper hand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]And black would have a seething attack in place![/DhtmlXQ_comment3_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_5]And red would still have control over the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4_5]
