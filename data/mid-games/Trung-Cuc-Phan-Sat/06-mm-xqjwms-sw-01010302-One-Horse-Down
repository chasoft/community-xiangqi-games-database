[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01010302 One Horse Down||||In this example, black has an extra horse and pawn. ||Red first.||Can red turn the tables?||Jim: Challenge question. Think before you click on.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Yes. (obviously...)||Black's horses has been offering adequate defense such that a kill by red is impossible.||Therefore, the correct strategy for red would be to go for a draw![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Red has not been able to organize an attack that would result in a checkmate.||Therefore, he chooses to exchange horses to weaken black's 1r2h combination, aiming for a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And it would be a 1r1h2a1e d 1r2a2e endgame.||||Conclusion:||In the past two examples, we can see that when you are at a one horse disadvantage ...:||||a) You must make full use of making the first move, and target the opponent's weakest spot board, hoping to gain material in order to gain an advantage.||||b) you may also try to exchange material so that the game becomes drawish.||||c) if you are successful in regaining lost material, you should try immediately to maneuver your chess pieces to attacking spots so that you would be in a position to kill or win.||||d) target your opponent's material so that after the exchange, what remains result in  a drawish situation. ||||e) and never forget to play defense by  moving your elephant(s) and advisor(s) to their best defensive positions so that the opponent would not be able to capture them and place you at  a disadvantage.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
