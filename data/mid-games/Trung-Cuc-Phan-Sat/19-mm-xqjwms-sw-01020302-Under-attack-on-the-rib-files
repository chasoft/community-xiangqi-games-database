[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020302 Under attack on the rib files||Qeustion:||If black were to move first, can he save himself from red's attack?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Ans: Yes.||This is the key move to forcing a draw.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]The only way whereby black can prevent losing his horse.||If the black horse is lost, red would surely win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment19]And black would have successfully simplified the endgame to that of a draw.||||Conclusion:||From the above two examples, we can come to the following conclusions:||a) First and foremost, IDENTIFY the major attacking piece that is attacking your rib file. Eliminate it or shoo it away is the thing to do immediately.||b) tactics you may consider to achieve the above mentioned goal: i) exchange of material, ii) use your strong pieces to attack that pesky piece, iii) force it away from its current intersection, file or rank, but one must always weigh the losses that may be incurred with such a tactic||c) when you cannot win, exchange of material is the best option you can have to try to weaken your opponent's attack. that way, he would not be able to win and your chances for a draw are greatly increased.||d) moving your king away from that rib file or using your weaker pieces (advisors/elephants) to try to save the king, would often lead to losses.||Jim: I believe the last point mentioned by Master Shang refers to real attacks on the rib file, not sham attacks.[/DhtmlXQ_comment19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]And black would suddenly be on the winning end of things.||Jim: The moves in the manual end here. Red must play H4-5 to prevent black's R3=4 checkmate. Black would be on the attack now and would have successfully overturned the tables.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_3]And suddenly, black would be much better!||Jim: Red would be on the losing end now even though red would still have the pawn advantage. This is because red's 1c1h1tp are too dispersed and cannot protect each other efficiently from black's chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_2]And things would have gotten from bad to worse for  black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_2]
