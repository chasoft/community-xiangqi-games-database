[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020101 Under attack from the center||Jim: This is the start of section two, which discusses how to come back from behind when being attacked from various different positions and when specific material is/are being attacked.||||As can be seen from the diagram, black's central elephant and advisor are under attack from red's cannons and chariot.||But black gets to move first and is able to turn the tables.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This would be the best move to make to resolve red's attack.||Black would now threaten to checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]And black would be prepared to kill with H3+4, while at the same time threaten to capture red's cannon.||Red would not be far from a loss.||In retrospect, playing K5=4 is perhaps the most important move for black to turn the tables.||Advancing the black horse to threaten to capture red's cannon is another very important strategy for black to build momentum.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]And black would win the game as 1r1c2p would be too much for red's 1r1p to handle.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_19]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]Ouch, and red loses his chariot.||Black would have a very easy time ahead.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_4]And red would still have a fight going on.||This outcome would not be as good as the main variation.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_4]
