[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020601 Cannon under attack||As can be seen, red's cannon is under attack by black's chariot and horse.||Both players have roughly equivalent material.||Red first.||Red can make use of the fact of moving first to save his cannon.||Jim: This was an actual game played, but I have not been able to find out more about it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]This would seem to be a good move, attacking the black chariot while at the same time offering protection by linking the cannons up together.||BUT, it would go against the principles that should be adhered to when your cannon is under attack.||A4+5 should be the correct move![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Moving the horse here would be the better move.||In actual play, red had played H3-5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And this would prevent black from attempting to checkmate with C5=6.||Red would have the material advantage and also be on the winning end of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]Actual move played in competition....[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]And black would have gained the horse.||This move was thought up during review of the game  after the competition ended.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_5]And red would have both the material and positional upperhand.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_5]
