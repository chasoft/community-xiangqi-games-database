[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020602 Cannon under attack||Black's cannon is under attack in this example.||Black first, can black turn the tables?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]A nice move.||Black chooses to be proactive and aggressive with this move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]And red chooses the wise and simple way out.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment12]Jim: This is to prevent black from playing C9=5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment12]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]And black would be prepared to play C9=5.||Red would be in trouble.||||Conclusion:||When your cannon is under attack, the following few points must be taken note off:||a) again, identify the opponent's key attacking piece, and try to remove this threat, thereby fortifying your weak areas. This can be done with a cannon sacrifice first, and then gaining back lost material later.||b) when you choose to to be aggressive, you must attack ruthelessly and never stop halfway to defend. Otherwise, your opponent would be prone to counter and you might pay a huge price for defending.||c) when you try to exchange material by trying to capture the opponent's major pieces, it must be done such that whatever the threat that your opponent had must be minimized or deleted.||d) when you decide to sacrifice your cannon, you must have thought up of a plan for a strong attack which hopefully would be able to regain lost material. The attack that you launch must enable you to gain material compensation or even kill. Even regional gains on the board must be able to to ensure that you get to keep your material upperhand.||e) after exchanging material, you must be able to maintain your advantage in the game||f) if you choose to adopt the sacrifice first and regain material later strategy, it must work. If not, after your sacrifice, if you opponent were allowed to continue attacking, it would not be worth it.[/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]And black would have managed to position his chariots to good places on the board.||Red would have lost some initiative and control of the game.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]Mistake...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]And red would not only have gained material, he would also have the positional advantage...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_1]Jim: hmm, if R6+5 was a viable option...what about this move...?||Too tired to analyze but this was not found in the book...[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_1]
