[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 010202 One Cannon Down||Challenge question:||If red moved first, would red be able to go for a draw?||Jim: Again, think before you look at the ans.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Correct move to make.||Red is unable to kill consecutively and this is the best move that red can make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Red is now threatening with a double check for the checkmate (H5+4). This is the only possible defense.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]When you are on the losing end, exchanging material to weaken the opponent's attack such that a draw is feasible is an often used tactic.||It is also crucial in this example.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And black's side pawn is caught.||The game would have simplified to 1r1hp2a2e pd 1r1h2a1e.||Conclusion:||When you are down a cannon, the following few points must be noted:||[color=indigo]1) you must make full use of making the first move to attack your opponent's weakest point on the board. [/color]||||[color=green]2) your attack must be organized in such a way that you would have an effective attack such that a kill is possible or your opponent might have to give up material to resolve it or substain greater losses. [/color]||||[color=blue]3) the attack lauched must be strong enough to actually threaten to win. [/color]||||[color=brown]4) Should you be unable to kill, your attack must be able to force your opponent to give up important material, so that it would be nearly impossible for him to win. [/color]||||[color=orange]5) To try to go for a kill when you are down material wise, you must have at least sufficent material to launch a threatening attack like a combination of 1r1h1c or 1r1h1p. Otherwise, aim for a draw.[/color]||Jim: some of the points i think are overlapped but you get the general idea.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]Game over.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]Oops...[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_8]And black would be on the losing end.||This is a mistake that most amateurs would make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]And red would suddenly have the huge advantage.||This is another mistake that many amateurs would make.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_5]
