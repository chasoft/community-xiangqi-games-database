[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 01020902 Pawn under attack||Question: ||Red first to move. Black's horse is forking the red pawn and cannon.||What should you protect, the pawn or the cannon?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]A bold but brilliant move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4]This is a commonly used tactic in defense to prevent the pawn/chariot from killing in a ranked manner.[/DhtmlXQ_comment4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And red would win.||Red is now threatening to checkmate with R8+2 and R8=6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]Face to face laughing checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3_9]Checkmate[/DhtmlXQ_comment3_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment4_9]And red would not be far from victory![/DhtmlXQ_comment4_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_3]And black loses even quicker.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_4]Jim: I added a few more moves for the beginner to visualize better.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_4]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]And black must sacrifice his chariot to prevent being killed.||Red wins.||||Conclusion:||When your pawn is under attack, the following must be taken into consideration:||1) if you decide to sacrifice a major piece for attack, the remaining pieces must be able to come together for an effective and efficient attack.||2) when you try to use the zugzwang "頓挫" tactic to maneuver your pieces, they must not allow your opponent a chance to defend or your efforts would come to naught.||3) if you decide to move the pawn to safety, this move must also threaten to attack the opponent's king or be able to assist the other material in attack.||4) when the pawn is already on the rib file or even in the opponent's palace, it must be able to limit the opponent's king. Unless absolutely necessary, do not move the pawn to the opponent's bottom rank as it would often lose its potential to limit the opponent's king||5) when using the pawn in an actual kill, the enuch chasing the emperor kill "太監追皇帝" or also known as three consecutive advancements of the pawn "三進兵" technique is used. Be sure you know this technique well.||Jim: This can be seen in the basic kills section under the Eunuch chasing the emperor kill||6) If the attacking combination is a 1r1c1p combination, often the pawn is on one rib file while the cannon is on the other rib file or vice versa. If the 1r1c1p combination were concentrated on one flank, it would be more efficient on the weak side where the opponent does not have defensive pieces to protect.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]And although red is better, it would still take some time for red to win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]And black would have to sacrifice his chariot.||Red would win.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7_13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8_10]And black would still be able to hold on![/DhtmlXQ_comment8_10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9_9]Checkmate.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9_9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10_2]And black would be on the winning end.||Red lacks elephants and would not be able to defend against an attack by black's 1r1h1p combination.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10_2]
