[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg fengsuo 02||One of my favorite games from the Elegant Pastime Xiangqi Manual. Game 42||Although a very short game, it is perhaps one of the most brilliant games exemplifying the containment/imprisonment tactic![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]It is a check that the black horse must resolve.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Note that the red pawn on the 7th file has the horse cornered.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]Another brilliant move!||Black has a mate with R5=4.||With this move, Black has no more mate as it is covered by red chariot, which it must take![/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Black's chariot is imprisoned by the two elephants and red horse. The black pawn at red's throat rank cannot move to the other side to free the chariot.||And red has a pawn on the 7th file, just only one pawn, that is free to attack.  ||Red would proceed to win by pushing the 7th file pawn across the river first and then taking away black's pawn. The 3rd filed pawn would also cross the river for the final kill.||Absolutely brilliant![/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
