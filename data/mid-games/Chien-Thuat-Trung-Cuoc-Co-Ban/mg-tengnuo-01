[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg ?? shifting 01||Shifting is the tactic discussed here. ||In this game, black's horse has clogged up the palace. The red horse has a chance for a checkmate, but it is blocked by his own chariot.||Under such circumstances, red decides to use the shifting tactic to win the game.||||===||||Tactic: Shifting ?? 01||||?? Shifting is the tactic discussed here. ||It is one of the hardest term to translate. I had originally coined it maneuvering, but after much consideration, I have decided to used the term given in the the free ebook found at WXF, which is shifting.  The reason for this is because maneuvering seems to be a better term than deployment, another commonly used tactic.||In Xiangqi, often a chess piece gets in the way of another piece, thus disallowing the blocked piece from living up to its full potential. For example, piece A is able to assist in a checkmate or gain advantage but it is is blocked by piece B. To allow piece A to live up to his potential, piece B is moved. The manner by which piece B is moved is key. Piece B may be sacrificed, or used to block your opponent's other pieces, or used to perform a check, or to position itself in a checkmate position...etc. And once piece B is moved, piece A is freed from its chains and can do damage.||The trick in this tactic is that during the removal of this roadblock, your opponent is forced unwillingly to allow the blocked piece to fulfil its potential as it has to resolve the trouble caused by the moved piece. ||Shifting is considered one of the harder tactics to use in Xiangqi and is a very aggressive method of play.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Since the red chariot is blocking the red horse from a checkmate (H8+6), red moves the chariot away, sacrificing it for a mate.||This is one sort of a maneuver.||Red's horse is freed to do damage now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]Black cannot move H4-3 or R7=3 for black would immediately checkmate with H8+6.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]A beautiful sacrifice necessary for the ensuing kill. The black chariot is lost now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Red would still win the game by taking the black chariot but there is a nice kill here.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]All this was made possible with the maneuver technique.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]Red can also take the chariot and have overwhelming positional and material advantage. ||Or he could make this move threatening with a checkmate.||There is no immediate kill for black.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]Red wins material and threatens with a checkmate of R8+2 A5-6, H8+6 R8-1...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]If the black king comes out, red will move R5=6 and take away the black horse with K5=4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_7]
