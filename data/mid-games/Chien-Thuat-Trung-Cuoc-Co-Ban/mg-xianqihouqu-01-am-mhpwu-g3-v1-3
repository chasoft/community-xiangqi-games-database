[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg xianqihouqu 01 am mhpwu g3 v1-3||This is one of the variations of the Plum Flower Manual by Wu, Game 3 variation 1-3.||Black has the positional advantage, and the solitary red chariot in black's side of the board can do nothing much.||But how can black enter midgame with a distinct advantage?||||====||||Tactic: ||Sacrifice Before Gaining Back  ||???? 01||||Sacrifice before Gaining Back ????||This is another commonly used tactic in actual play. Very practical.||Sometimes, in actual play, you need to sacrifice a piece first to break open a deadlock. However, this sacrifice is only made when you have full confidence that you will gain equivalent material, in addition to control of the game. ||This sacrifice would force your opponent to take it, thereby giving up whatever good positioning or advantage that he originally had, thus lessening the threat he had over you. After the sacrifice, you would be able to take the lost piece back in equivalent material.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Red thinks that he can win material back and it would be an even game...[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]But black starts his attack![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]Great move, Black sacrifices first , knowing that he will win back the sacrifice, and much more![/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment15]And it is obvious that black has the superior advantage! Once the black pawns cross the river, red is done for.[/DhtmlXQ_comment15]
