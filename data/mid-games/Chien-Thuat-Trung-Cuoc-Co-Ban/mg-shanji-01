[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg shanji 01||Black is one move away from a kill with R8+9. Red could win with a kill if his left cannon were allowed to attack from the side.||||====||||Tactic: Discovered Attack ?? 01||||?? Discovered Attack is the tactic discussed here. The Hanyu Pinyin for this term is shan3ji2. ||||This is the cousin of the Discovered Check. In Xiangqi, often a chess piece gets in the way of another piece, thus disallowing the blocked piece from living up to its full potential. Sometimes, this is deliberately done. ||For example, piece A is able to assist in a checkmate or gain advantage but it is is blocked by piece B. To allow piece A to live up to his potential, piece B is moved. The manner by which piece B is moved is key. Piece B may be sacrificed, or used to block your opponent's other pieces, or used to perform a check, or to position itself in a checkmate position...etc. And once piece B isplayed, piece A is freed to do damage.||||The trick in this tactic is that during the removal of this roadblock, your opponent is forced unwillingly to allow the blocked piece to fulfil its potential as it has to resolve the trouble caused by the moved piece.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Hole in hole out checkmate. ||In this example, the early chariot sacrifice by red allows for the cannons to do their magic.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
