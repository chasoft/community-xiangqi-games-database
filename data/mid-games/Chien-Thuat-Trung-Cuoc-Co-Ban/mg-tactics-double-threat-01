[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg tactics double threat 01||You threaten your oppoenent with 2 threats eg a kill, a gain in material etc with the same move. This is the double threat tactic.||In this game, Black is one move away from a kill with C2+9.||However, Red moves first and is able to use this tactic to turn the tables.||||====||||Tactic: Double Threat  ???? 01||||???? Double threat is the tactic discussed here. ||||I found this tactic in a beginner's manual <<??????>> by ??? Fu Baosheng. I think I have seen it mentioned in one or two other manuals. Basically, it is the combination of >=2 tactics with the same move.||||When playing Xiangqi, efficiency of the moves is key. If you are able to do many things with one move, the efficiency of that move will be very high and would normally increase your advantage or let you turn the tables on your opponent. The double threat technique exemplifies this concept.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
