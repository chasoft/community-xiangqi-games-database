[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg shifting 03||Fig 2 from the free ebook Basic Xiangqi tactics||In this example, black's right flank is relatively empty and his central horse is protecting both advisors so there is no immediate black kill. ||Red decides to attack black's right flank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2]In retrospect this would be a bad move.||It was suggested that black played R6-6. Black would be comparatively better than red in this scenario.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Red is ready for attack now.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]The same applies to E7-5.||The stage is set for red to win the game.||If the central horse could join in the attack there would be a kill. But black's 4th file (red's 6th file) chariot is threatening with a kill should the horse move. Besides, the chariot could help protect and defend should need be.||How can Red overcome the obstacle of the black chariot and push forward the horse?[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Red uses the maneuver technique.||With this move, many things are achieved.||1) the bottom ranked horse is now unprotected.||2) the central cannon had been previously blocking the horse, now the horse can charge into battle.||3) there is direct pressure with a red chariot sacrifice/tempt. If black chooses to move E7-5 to protect the horse, R1=6 would result in a very quick kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment8]Black has no choice but to accept the red chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment8]
[DhtmlXQ_comment10]Black tries to defend.||If black did not make this move, R1-3 would start the kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment10]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]There is no way black can resolve red's H6+7 checkmate.||All this was made possible with red's use of the shifting tactic in move 4.[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
