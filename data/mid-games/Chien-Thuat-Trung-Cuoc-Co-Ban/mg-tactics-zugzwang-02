[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg tactics zugzwang 02||Game adapted from <<??????>> by ??? ||In this game, black's right flank is empty and relatively unprotected.||Red will attack black's right flank (red's left) but a cannon and chariot are just not enough to make a kill.||Red needs to bring the horse or central pawn into the attack, but how?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]The black central horse offers some black defense and can impede red's attack.||With this Zugzwang, black is forced to move the horse.[/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]Great move. The cannon move achieves the following,||1) guard against black's possible elbow horse attack (H6+8 followed by H8+7)||2) control the bottom rank allowing the black king only limited space to run for his life||3) enticing the remaining black elephant to move to the center or lose the side horse with red's R8+2 check followed by R8-1...and when the elephant moves to the center, the king is now severely limited in his possible escape routes.[/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]The red horse finally gets a piece of the action!||H7+8 would kill or gain the black chariot with a check/fork.||This is another Zugwang...forcing the black chariot to defend.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]Red is in full control now.||On the defensive side, there is no black kill as the cannon has black's possible elbow horse checkmate covered.||On the offensive side, black's king is stranded on the rooftop of his palace.||Red has many choices for attack on his next move, like P5+1...||Black is in deep trouble now...[/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
