[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg yunzi am jqqq g080||This is a puzzle similar game 84 of the same manual.||A brief analysis of the game shows that red's pawn has basically controlled the movement of the black king.||The red horse is temporarily unable to checkmate as the black cannon is blocking it. ||The only piece that black can move is the elephant. If the elephant is able to move too the center, it could help defend... ||The only way that red can win is to maneuver the horse to such a position whereby the cannon cannot block it or to capture either the elephant or cannon.||||========||||||Tactic: Maneuver ?? 01||||Maneuver ?? (Hanyu Pinyin Yun4zi3)||Simply put this is the tactic whereby you move a chess piece to a better position for attack or defence. After the maneuver, it has more function and can cause trouble to your opponent.  ||It can refer to any of your chesspieces but usually, it is used to refer to moving a major chess piece like the chariot, horse, cannon or sometimes the pawn. The beauty is that through the process of deploying that chess piece, you gain control/initiative/material... and sometimes even a kill.||This is perhaps the most basic of the tactics, but I personally think that it is also the hardest to master.||All the GMs are super masters in this tactic, but I personally have the most praise for GM Li Laiqun![/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]important idle move! ||forcing the black elephant to move to the side.||If the elephant were allowed to move to the center, red's attack would take even longer![/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]The only move possible for black. ||H5+7 would mate.||If C3-1, red would capture that cannon with P5=6 (check) followed by P6=7, otherwise, red would simply mate with H5+7.[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]another important move. red controls the side armpit file , and frees the horse to do trouble.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]red attempts a checkmate with P6=5...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment14]the black cannon is not pinned by the red king now, freeing the horse to to concentrate attack, without the hindrance of the pesky cannon.[/DhtmlXQ_comment14]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]This is a faster way to a kill. ||Red could move the horse back to his own side of the board, beneath the red king to the otherside for the win but it would be much longer.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment23]a great move! ||black must now move its pieces to unfavourable positions.||If E7+5/E7+9, the horse would capture it and red would be guranteed a win.||If it moves the cannon, P5=4 would mate![/DhtmlXQ_comment23]
