[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg yuhui am jnms g177||Seemingly simple endgame with much to learn.||This is also one of the more famous endgame puzzles, and allegedly had something to do with a hero in the Southern Song dynasty by the name of ||???.||It is also quite a famous endgame.||Red has black in a figure of four leglock. All of black's pieces can only move in this file. There are still a few spots on the board that the king and chariot can move. To win, red has to eliminate these spaces too.||Now red has to think of a way to maneuver the horse to the other side to assist in the kill, but the black chariot can block the horses path.||So how does red accomplish all this?[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment5]red's horse cannot move to the center or the black king would move K6=5 and red would lose![/DhtmlXQ_comment5]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]Very important move! ||Red effectively eliminates one intersection so that the black chariot has less room to move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]The king protects the cannon and...now red has made enough room for the horse to go around from behind![/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment13]The horse is now on the correct side of the board![/DhtmlXQ_comment13]
[DhtmlXQ_comment17]Further limiting the room that the chariot can move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment17]
[DhtmlXQ_comment21]a very important move, forcing the king back to the bottom rank.[/DhtmlXQ_comment21]
[DhtmlXQ_comment25]Black's chariot has to take the cannon and it would be a surewin situation for red now![/DhtmlXQ_comment25]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]red would win so much quicker this way![/DhtmlXQ_comment1_21]
