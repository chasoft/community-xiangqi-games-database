[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg yinli am jqqq g112||Black has an immediate kill with H7-6.||Red has the superior material advantage but his pieces are too sparsely located.||Red has to make use of this tactic to allow his pieces to come together for an effective blow.||||||====||||Tactic: Lure Away ?? 01||||?? Lure Away||In the course of a game, there will be pieces that would threaten your king directly. It follows naturally to try and shoo them away.||When using this tactic, you offer, sacrifice or use a variety of maneuvers to FORCE that threatening piece to move to a much worse position, whereby it hinders the other pieces or puts the opponent in danger.  ||In much simpler terms, it means forcing your opponent to move a well-positioned piece that is capable of attack to a position which is much worse, where it loses its attacking abilities.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]Great move! With this move, black is forced to raise the advisor to the palace corner, allowing red full control of the center!||This is a good example of the tactic.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment11]the black pawn is the last piece preventing red from winning...[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
