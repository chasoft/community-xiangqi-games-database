[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg fengsuo 01||Black has more pawns but red has better positioning of the pieces!||||||====||||||Tactic: Blockade ??||||Blockade ?? (Hanyu Pinyin feng1suo3) :||I had originally termed this tactic: imprisonment. But it just did not sound right. ||When you use this tactic, you force your targeted opponent's chesspiece into a small area, rendering it relatively immobile. If it tries to break through or break out, there would be loss of material or even greater losses to be sustained.||This is different from the tactic ?? or containment whereby your opponent's chesspiece is weakened or cannot perform to its abilities. When you blockade a piece, it does not lose its ability ,once it is free, it may return to do harm to its abilities.  Sometimes, these two tactics are very similar and can be hard to differentiate.||And many a time, these two tactics are used together.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
