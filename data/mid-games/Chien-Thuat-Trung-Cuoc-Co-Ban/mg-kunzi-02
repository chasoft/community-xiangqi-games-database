[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mg kunzi 02||Black's pieces are relatively immobile compared to red's. However, the black central cannon is applying pressure on red's center.||There is no immediate kill for red, so red decides to win material first.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1]A decisive move. Black is forced to move the cannon to take the horse and thus give up the pressure he is applying on red's center.||If red moved H3+5 to take the cannon instead...click on the variation below to see what will happen...[/DhtmlXQ_comment1]
[DhtmlXQ_comment3]The black cannon is now trapped![/DhtmlXQ_comment3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment6]Black cannot move C9-1 or red would win it by moving R2+1 for a check. So black tries for an exchange...[/DhtmlXQ_comment6]
[DhtmlXQ_comment7]... which red does not want, of course!||Correct move!||Red cannot rush his moves and be greedy with H4+3...||Click on the variation below to understand why.[/DhtmlXQ_comment7]
[DhtmlXQ_comment9]And red is sure to win over the cannon. ||Red has the advantage going into the latter part of the midgame or the earlier part of the endgame.[/DhtmlXQ_comment9]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]and black returns the favor of trapping the red horse.||If red moved R9-3 to exchange two pawns for the horse, it would be a drawish game.||Gaining a major piece going into endgame is much better!||That is why the red horse cannot rush and move H4+3 on the fourth move.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
[DhtmlXQ_comment2_4]And it would still be a relatively even game. Red has not gained much with this exchange.[/DhtmlXQ_comment2_4]
